//! End-to-end coverage for the mixed distributed (multi-chunk) + recursive
//! setup-offload profile.
//!
//! This test uses `RecursiveCommitmentConfig<fp128::D64OneHotMultiChunk>` (the
//! production `W8R2` preset, `fp128_d64_onehot_recursive_multi_chunk_w8r2`
//! family): two precommitted singleton groups at `nv=16` and a two-polynomial
//! final group at `nv=32`. That schedule combines the `W8R2` chunked witness
//! layout (8 chunks on the two leading fold levels) with recursive setup
//! offloading (Stage-3 setup-product sum-check and a carried setup-prefix
//! opening), so a successful proof exercises the mix: chunked folds that also
//! run the offloaded setup-contribution path.
