## Summary

The optional `zk` Cargo feature is **opt-in, prefix-only, and not actually
zero-knowledge today** — enabling it produces sound, verifying proofs, not ZK
proofs (the `sec:zk-joint-sigma` seam and suffix modulus switching are
unimplemented; the tail is discharged by a plain opening). See
[`book/src/roadmap/zero-knowledge.md`](../book/src/roadmap/zero-knowledge.md) and
[`specs/archive/2026-Q2/akita-zk-sumcheck-hiding-plain.md`](archive/2026-Q2/akita-zk-sumcheck-hiding-plain.md).

For the upcoming audit we want the transparent protocol to be the product under
review, with **zero ZK in the auditor's reading path** — the ~1,200
`#[cfg(feature = "zk")]` sites (826 positive + 295 `not(zk)` + Cargo defs)
fracture the hottest orchestration files (`wire.rs` 94, prover `fold.rs` 78,
`setup.rs` 64, `levels.rs` 52, verifier `fold.rs` 49). We do **not** want to
throw the ZK work away: it will be finished after the audit.

This spec removes all ZK from `main` into a preserved `zk-wip` branch + tag
("strip-to-branch"), keeps the one genuinely generic, pure-arithmetic helper
(LHL sizing math) always-on as `lhl_blinding`, and sequences the removal into
verifiable slices. **Slices 0–4d** preserve transparent proof bytes, transcript
bytes (except the instance-descriptor preamble, see 4e), and verification
behavior; **4e** lands one reviewed descriptor-v1 preamble re-pin, then **4f**
retires the proof-byte golden tripwire.

### Implementation status (PR #218)

**Landed in [#218](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/akita/pull/218)** (mergeable
milestone; transparent path only):

| Slice | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 0 | Preservation refs + golden tripwire | Done |
| 1 | `lhl_blinding` always-on | Done |
| 2 | ZK-only tests + `*_zk.rs` schedules | Done |
| 3 | Setup `zkB`/`zkD` matrices + drop `akita-r1cs` | Done |
| CI | Drop `all-features` / zk schedule-drift legs; transparent merge gate | Done (#218) |

**Follow-up PRs** (slice 4 split into 5 review PRs; CI/feature deletion folded into 4e — no separate slice 5; see [Execution](#execution--sequenced-slices)):

| PR | Scope | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| 4a–4d | Verifier + prover ZK path removal (consolidated in #220) | In review |
| 4e | Schema unification + residual sweep + delete `zk` Cargo features + `akita-r1cs/` (→ global grep = 0) | In review |
| 4f | Retire Slice-0 / verify-side proof-byte golden (post-strip only) | In review |

As of `c998034f`, `main` still carries ~940 `feature = "zk"` lines across
`crates/**/src` (verifier ~204, prover ~435, types ~275, sumcheck ~29, config ~39,
setup ~15, planner ~14, pcs ~60, algebra ~7, challenges ~6) — all dead on the
default build. `--features zk` does not build. Auditors reviewing transparent code
can use `main`; full "zero ZK in tree" waits for PRs 4a–4e.

Preservation: branch `zk-wip` and tag `zk-prefix-snapshot-2026-06` at `2c6b6b1f`.

## Intent

### Goal

Remove every `#[cfg(feature = "zk")]` / `#[cfg(not(feature = "zk"))]` site and
the `zk` Cargo feature itself from `main`, preserving the complete ZK state on a
`zk-wip` branch and an annotated tag, while promoting `akita-types/src/zk.rs`
(pure LHL capacity arithmetic) to an always-compiled `lhl_blinding` module.

Affected surfaces:

- **Proof types & wire** (`akita-types`): drop the cfg-gated `zk_hiding` field on
  `AkitaBatchedProof` ([`levels.rs:1117`](../crates/akita-types/src/proof/levels.rs)),
  the `sumcheck_proof` ↔ `sumcheck_proof_masked` / `next_w_eval` ↔
  `next_w_eval_masked` field-swaps in `levels.rs` / `wire.rs`, and the
  `zk_b_matrix` / `zk_d_matrix` fields + constructors + serde in
  [`setup.rs`](../crates/akita-types/src/proof/setup.rs).
- **Prover orchestration** (`akita-prover/src/protocol/core/{prove,fold,suffix,root_fold}.rs`,
  `core.rs`): delete `ZkHidingProverState`, `build_zk_hiding_context`, pad
  helpers, the `+ mask` arms, and the cfg-gated parameters threaded through the
  fold chain.
- **Verifier orchestration** (`akita-verifier/src/protocol/core/{verify,fold}.rs`,
  `core/zk.rs`, `slice_mle/zk_blinding.rs`): delete `verify_zk_hiding_commitment`,
  the `zk_hiding_cursor` / `ZkRelationAccumulator` threading, and `core/zk.rs`.
- **Commitment blinding** (`akita-prover/src/protocol/ring_switch/{commit,evals}.rs`,
  `masking.rs`, `zk_hiding_commit.rs`): delete B/D digit blinding and the hiding
  commitment.
- **Masked sumcheck** (`akita-sumcheck`): delete `SumcheckProofMasked`,
  `EqFactoredSumcheckProofMasked`, and the `prove_zk` / `verify_zk` drivers.
- **Deferred R1CS** (`akita-r1cs`): remove the crate from the workspace (zk-only;
  preserved on branch).
- **Schedules** (`akita-schedules`): delete the `*_zk.rs` generated tables and
  reconcile the `*_table()` selectors.
- **Cargo**: delete the `zk = [...]` feature from every crate
  ([13 crates](#feature-cascade-to-delete)).
- **Keep always-on**: `akita-types/src/zk.rs` → `lhl_blinding.rs` (pure math).

### Invariants

| # | Invariant | Why it holds | Protected by |
|---|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| I1 | Transparent (default-build) proof bytes are unchanged through slice 4d; 4e lands descriptor v1 at version 1 without bumping. | The default build never compiled any `#[cfg(feature="zk")]` line; 4e preserves schedule witness-shape descriptor tags and re-pins golden once for the v1 preamble. | Slice-0 golden (slices 0–4e); retired in 4f; then serde roundtrips + `akita_e2e.rs` |
| I2 | Transparent transcript bytes/labels are unchanged through 4d; 4e's sole transcript change is the instance-descriptor preamble (v1, no version bump). | The only zk absorb (`ABSORB_ZK_HIDING_COMMITMENT`) is itself zk-gated; the masked next-w-eval feeds the *same* single `append_serde(ABSORB_STAGE2_NEXT_W_EVAL, …)` whose value on the non-zk path is the genuine unmasked `w_eval` ([`fold.rs:873-877`](../crates/akita-prover/src/protocol/core/fold.rs)). Labels never enter the sponge (`labels.rs`, `sponge.rs` ignores the label arg). Fold-chain absorbs are unchanged. | `transcript_is_deterministic_for_identical_schedule`; sponge `labels_do_not_enter_production_sponge` |
| I3 | Transparent sumcheck claim absorbs (`ABSORB_SUMCHECK_CLAIM`) stay unchanged; zk-only sumcheck drivers (`prove_zk`/`verify_zk`, masked round polys, zk EOR replay in `fold.rs`) are deleted wholesale and must not be folded into transparent `prove`/`verify` or orchestration. | Transparent paths already emit one claim absorb per sumcheck (standard/eq-factored drivers, batched stage-3, EOR verifier); zk drivers are cfg-swapped siblings using the same label. Slice 4 must drop zk arms verbatim without changing which transparent caller absorbs which claim value. | I2 transcript test; code review |
| I4 | Setup serialization for the transparent path is unchanged. | `zk_b_matrix`/`zk_d_matrix` are serialized strictly *after* shared fields, only under cfg; no `not(zk)` padding counterpart. | Setup serialize→deserialize roundtrip (`setup.rs` tests) |
| I5 | The non-zk path is the live production path (no orphaned stubs). | Stub sweep found zero `todo!`/`unimplemented!` in any `not(zk)` branch. | `cargo check` default build |
| I6 | `--features zk` is allowed to break partway through the strip (it is being removed); only the default build must pass after every slice. | The feature is the deletion target. | Slice gates below |

### Non-Goals

- **No `akita-zk-prefix` plugin crate, no dependency-inversion hooks.** Rejected
  (see [Alternatives](#alternatives-considered)): infeasible without first
  inverting three core abstractions, creates a Cargo cycle, and ossifies a
  boundary the roadmap says finished-ZK will discard.
- **No in-tree `protocol/zk/` submodule relocation.** It leaves cfg-gated
  parameters/fields/branches visible in `fold.rs`/`wire.rs`/`levels.rs` — does not
  meet "zero ZK in the auditor's path."
- **No change to transparent proof format, fold-chain transcript, or planner output through 4d.** 4e's reviewed descriptor-v1 preamble re-pin is the sole intentional wire change in slice 4.
- **No attempt to keep `--features zk` building on `main`** after the strip.
- **No fix of the planner↔prover `zk_hiding_witness_len` drift** — it is
  confirmed harmless (conservative `≥` headroom) and is deleted with both
  functions.
- **No completion of real ZK** (seam, suffix modulus switching, LNP22) — that is
  post-audit, off the `zk-wip` branch.

## Evaluation

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `rg -n 'feature *= *"zk"' crates/ -g '*.rs'` returns **0** matches on `main`.
      The audit-clean gate is **crate code only** (`crates/**/*.rs`). Historical specs
      under `specs/archive/` and pre-strip umbrella specs may retain `zk` references
      until a separate doc archive pass.
- [ ] No crate's `Cargo.toml` defines a `zk` feature; `akita-r1cs` is removed from
      `[workspace] members` and from all `optional`/`dep:` references.
- [x] `cargo check --workspace --no-default-features --features parallel,disk-persistence`
      succeeds (transparent merge gate; #218).
- [ ] `cargo clippy --all --all-targets -- -D warnings` and the `--no-default-features` variant both pass without any `zk` feature in existence.
- [x] The Slice-0 golden-byte digests were **byte-identical across slices 0–4d**
      (`fp128::D64Dense` nv=15 → `c99fcc18…b767072`; `fp128::D64OneHot` nv=20 →
      `4849bef9…cd0daf1b`). **PR 4e** kept `AKITA_INSTANCE_DESCRIPTOR_VERSION`
      at **`1`** (no bump), restored schedule witness-shape descriptor tags, and
      re-pinned once (`f96dd986…` / `480a6bc9…`). **Retired in PR 4f**: the
      test file `crates/akita-pcs/tests/transparent_proof_golden.rs` is deleted
      so intentional protocol evolution is not blocked by pinned SHA-256 constants.
- [x] `lhl_blinding` compiles in the default build, its unit tests pass, and it is
      no longer behind any `cfg`.
- [x] A `zk-wip` branch and an annotated tag (`zk-prefix-snapshot-2026-06`)
      exist at the pre-strip commit.
- [x] CI: the `test-all-features` / zk schedule-drift legs are removed; the
      `test` leg is the merge gate (#218).
- [ ] No `todo!`/`unimplemented!`/dead `let _ = (zk…)` shims remain from the strip.

### Testing Strategy

**Authoritative gate after every slice** (mirrors CI `test` job):

```bash
cargo nextest run --no-default-features --features parallel,disk-persistence
cargo check --workspace --no-default-features --features parallel,disk-persistence
cargo clippy --all --all-targets --no-default-features -- -D warnings
```

**Slice-0 tripwire** (added before any deletion, **retired in PR 4f**):
`crates/akita-pcs/tests/transparent_proof_golden.rs` pinned SHA-256 of serialized
transparent proofs for two **folded** instances (`fp128::D64Dense` nv=15 and
`fp128::D64OneHot` nv=20) plus a verify-side deserialize→`batched_verify` check.
It gated invariant I1 during slices 0–4e only. After 4f, use serde roundtrips
and e2e prove/verify tests instead of fixed proof-byte digests.

**Verify-side golden** (added in PR 4a, retired with 4f): the golden test
deserialized pinned proof bytes and asserted the verifier accepted them. That
behavioral pin is no longer in-tree after the strip completes.

**`--features zk` leg:** was run on slices 0–2 only. After slice 3 (`akita-r1cs`
removed) and slice 2 (zk schedules deleted), `cargo … --all-features` is expected
to fail until slice 4–5 finish. CI no longer runs this leg (#218).

**Schedule drift** (critical for Slice 2):

```bash
cargo test -p akita-config generated_schedule_tables_match_find_schedule
cargo test -p akita-config --no-default-features --test schedule_catalog_feature_off
```

**Tests deleted** (zk-only): `crates/akita-pcs/tests/zk.rs` (9 fns),
`crates/akita-pcs/tests/fold_linf_zk.rs` (3 fns), the two `zk_*` fns in
`single_poly_tensor_e2e.rs`, and the ~24 inline `#[cfg(feature="zk")]` test
modules. **Tests kept** (transparent): the 7 core e2e files (`akita_e2e.rs`,
`batched_aggregated_e2e.rs`, `heterogeneous_prove_e2e.rs`,
`recursive_setup_e2e.rs`, `single_poly_e2e.rs`) and ~44
unconditional test files.

### Performance

No prover/verifier performance change on the transparent path (the stripped code
never executed in the default build). Expected secondary wins: faster
compilation and a smaller workspace (one fewer crate, ~1,200 fewer cfg sites).
Benchmarks are all transparent (`crates/akita-pcs/benches/*`) and unaffected; no
zk-specific bench exists.

## Design

### Architecture

ZK enters the codebase as a **compile-time bifurcation woven through the proof
type system and wire format**, not a localized plugin seam. The dependency
arrows already point inward (prover/verifier/setup → types; nothing depends on a
"zk crate" except the leaf `akita-r1cs`). The clean removal therefore deletes the
gated arms in place and keeps the `not(zk)` arms the default build already used.

Four entanglement classes, in ascending difficulty:

1. **`zk_hiding` envelope on `AkitaBatchedProof`** — *easy.* Already a leading,
   fully cfg-gated wire envelope with a zk-only transcript absorb. Delete the
   field, its 4 serde arms (`wire.rs`), and the prove/verify blocks
   ([`prove.rs:337-350`](../crates/akita-prover/src/protocol/core/prove.rs),
   [`verify.rs:632-641`](../crates/akita-verifier/src/protocol/core/verify.rs)).

2. **B/D commitment blinding** — *easy–moderate.* Additive-only and fully gated:
   `commit_w` adds `zk_b_digit_rows` to `u` only under cfg; the transparent build
   always committed the unblinded value. Delete the blinding blocks in
   `ring_switch/commit.rs`, the zk segments in `ring_switch/evals.rs`,
   `zk_hiding_commit.rs`, `masking.rs`, and the verifier recompute. **Cannot become
   an always-on hiding helper** — it changes committed bytes and needs the zk-only
   setup matrices + proof fields to discharge.

3. **Field-swapping in `levels.rs` / `wire.rs`** — *moderate, mechanical.* The
   masked types (`SumcheckProofMasked`, `EqFactoredSumcheckProofMasked`) are
   byte-identical newtypes over the transparent ones, so the wire bytes and shapes
   are identical across builds. Delete the `_masked` fields/arms (~24 doubled serde
   arms + cfg constructor params) and keep the transparent `sumcheck_proof` /
   `next_w_eval` fields unconditionally. **No transparent byte change.**

4. **Masked sumcheck through fold replay** — *the hard one.* Pads are sliced by a
   cursor from a single committed `hiding_witness` in `ZkHidingProverState`,
   threaded forward through the entire fold chain; the verifier mirrors the exact
   cursor offset arithmetic. This is real coupling: ~10 function signatures across
   prover + verifier carry cfg-gated positional params, plus the `+ mask` on
   `next_w_eval`. The drivers are already cleanly swapped via `cfg_if!`
   (`prove` vs `prove_zk`, `verify` vs `verify_zk`), so deletion = remove the zk
   driver wholesale (zk-only driver arms vanish — invariant I3) and strip the
   gated params from the shared signatures.

#### What stays vs goes

| Keep on `main` (always-on) | Strip to `zk-wip` branch |
|---|---|
| `akita-types/src/zk.rs` → `lhl_blinding.rs` (pure LHL capacity math) | `ZkHidingProverState`, `build_zk_hiding_context`, pad helpers (`core.rs`) |
| (its self-contained unit tests) | `zk_hiding` field + `ZkHidingProof` (`levels.rs`/`containers.rs`) |
| | `sumcheck_proof_masked` / `next_w_eval_masked` fields (`levels.rs`/`wire.rs`) |
| | `zk_b_matrix`/`zk_d_matrix` + `derive_zk_*`/`validate_*zk*` (`setup.rs`) |
| | B/D blinding (`ring_switch/{commit,evals}.rs`, `masking.rs`, `zk_hiding_commit.rs`) |
| | `prove_zk`/`verify_zk` + `SumcheckProofMasked` (`akita-sumcheck`) |
| | `akita-r1cs` crate (deferred R1CS, zk-only) |
| | verifier `core/zk.rs`, `slice_mle/zk_blinding.rs` |
| | `*_zk.rs` generated schedule tables (`akita-schedules`) |
| | `zk = [...]` features in all 13 Cargo.toml |

**On keeping `lhl_blinding` always-on:** after the strip its consumers
(`schedule.rs`, `proof_size.rs`, `ring_relation.rs`, `proof_optimized.rs`,
`masking.rs`, …) are all deleted, so it has **no live caller on `main`**. That is
the intended "generic infra, standalone / cut off": it is pure, tested capacity
arithmetic that documents the hiding-mask sizing discipline and gives the
post-audit ZK work a stable anchor. Add a module doc note: *"LHL hiding-mask
capacity math, reserved for the optional hiding-commitment layer; not used by the
transparent protocol."* See [Open Questions](#open-questions) for the
alternative of sending it to the branch too.

#### Feature cascade to delete

Current `zk = [...]` graph (all to be removed):

```
akita-pcs/zk      -> akita-config/zk, akita-prover/zk, akita-setup/zk, akita-types/zk, akita-verifier/zk
akita-config/zk   -> akita-planner/zk, akita-types/zk, akita-schedules?/zk
akita-setup/zk    -> akita-config/zk, akita-prover/zk, akita-types/zk
akita-prover/zk   -> akita-config/zk, akita-sumcheck/zk, akita-types/zk, rand_core/getrandom
akita-verifier/zk -> dep:akita-r1cs, akita-r1cs/zk, akita-config/zk, akita-sumcheck/zk, akita-types/zk
akita-sumcheck/zk -> dep:akita-r1cs, akita-algebra/zk, akita-r1cs/zk, akita-transcript/zk
akita-types/zk    -> akita-sumcheck/zk
akita-planner/zk  -> akita-types/zk
akita-challenges/zk -> akita-transcript/zk
akita-schedules/zk  -> akita-planner/zk
akita-algebra/zk, akita-transcript/zk, akita-r1cs/zk -> []  (leaf stubs)
```

`zk` is in **no** crate's `default` features (verified: `akita-types` `default = []`,
`akita-pcs` `default = ["parallel","schedules-default"]`, etc.), so the default
build is already the transparent path.

### Execution — sequenced slices

Each slice is independently committable and gated by the transparent test run.
Slices 0–4e also required the Slice-0 golden digest when that test existed.
Slices 1–3 landed in [#218](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/akita/pull/218).
Slice 4 depends on 1–3 and ships as PRs 4a–4e; PR 4f retires the golden
tripwire **after** 4e merges (see [PR 4f](#slice-4f--retire-golden-tripwire)).
The final schema PR (4e) also removes the `zk` Cargo features and the
`akita-r1cs/` dir (the old "slice 5", now folded in — its CI half already
landed in #218).

**Slice 0 — Preserve + tripwire.** ✅ *Landed #218*
- `git branch zk-wip` at current `main`; `git tag -a zk-prefix-snapshot-2026-06`.
- Add the transparent golden-byte test + transcript-determinism test on `main`;
  commit the pinned digest constant. This is the tripwire for I1/I2.
- *Verify:* default test run green; record the digest.

**Slice 1 — Promote LHL math to always-on (`lhl_blinding`).** ✅ *Landed #218*
- `git mv crates/akita-types/src/zk.rs crates/akita-types/src/lhl_blinding.rs`.
- In `lib.rs`: replace `#[cfg(feature = "zk")] pub mod zk;` with un-gated
  `pub mod lhl_blinding;` and add the doc note.
- Repoint existing consumers from `crate::zk::…` to `crate::lhl_blinding::…`
  (they stay zk-gated for now — an always-on module is visible to gated code).
- *Verify:* default + `--features zk` both green (consumers still exist this slice).

**Slice 2 — Delete zk-only tests + reconcile generated schedules.** ✅ *Landed #218*
- Delete `crates/akita-pcs/tests/{zk.rs,fold_linf_zk.rs}`, the `zk_*` fns in
  `single_poly_tensor_e2e.rs`, the ~24 inline `#[cfg(feature="zk")]` test modules.
- Delete the `*_zk.rs` files under `crates/akita-schedules/src/generated/` and
  reconcile each `*_table()` in `generated/mod.rs` (drop the `#[cfg(zk)]` arm,
  un-gate the `not(zk)` arm, drop `pub mod *_zk;`).
- *Verify:* default green; `--features zk` may now fail to *find* deleted tables —
  acceptable; schedule-drift test green on the transparent leg.

**Slice 3 — Tear down setup blinding (`zk_b`/`zk_d`) + remove `akita-r1cs`.** ✅ *Landed #218*
- Delete `zk_b_matrix`/`zk_d_matrix` fields, `derive_zk_*`, `validate_*zk*`,
  `ZK_*_LABEL`, `max_zk_b_len`/`max_zk_d_len`, and their serde/`Valid` arms in
  `proof/setup.rs`; reconcile the two non-test construction sites
  (`api/setup.rs`, `akita-setup/src/lib.rs`). `AkitaCommitmentHint` blinding-digit
  arity cleanup deferred to slice 4 (still cfg-gated on the default build).
- Remove `akita-r1cs` from `[workspace] members` and from `dep:`/feature lines in
  `akita-verifier` and `akita-sumcheck`.
- *Verify:* default green + setup serde roundtrip; golden digest unchanged.

**Slice 4 — Tear down core orchestration (the heart).** ⏳ *Follow-up — split into 5 review PRs 4a–4e*

Slice 4 is large (~700 dead-on-default cfg sites), so it ships as **five sequential
PRs for maintainer reviewability**. The split is a *review* convenience, not a
correctness boundary: because every zk site is dead on the default build, *any*
ordering of **4a–4d** keeps the default build green and the golden digests
unchanged. **4e** accepts one reviewed descriptor-v1 preamble re-pin (golden
re-pins once); **4f** retires the golden tripwire after that. The order below is
chosen so that **consumers are deleted before the schema they consume**, making
the final schema PR a pure dead-field removal (lowest risk).

Ordering invariants (must hold regardless of how PRs are merged/split):
- **OI-1 — Cargo features stay until 4e.** PRs 4a–4d delete only `.rs` cfg code;
  they do **not** touch any `zk = [...]` Cargo feature. Removing one crate's `zk`
  feature while another crate's feature graph still references it (e.g.
  `akita-pcs/zk → akita-verifier/zk`) breaks feature resolution. All feature
  deletion is atomic in 4e.
- **OI-2 — Masked-type definitions die last.** `SumcheckProofMasked` /
  `EqFactoredSumcheckProofMasked` (defined in `akita-sumcheck`) are referenced by
  `levels.rs`/`wire.rs` (schema), `prove_zk` (prover), and `verify_zk` (verifier).
  Delete the *drivers* with their consumer PR, but delete the *type definitions*
  only in the schema PR (4e), the last referent.
- **OI-3 — `--features zk` is not a gate.** It is already broken post-slice-3 and
  stays broken; never "fix" it. Only the default build + golden are gates.

Per-PR Definition of Done (uniform — all must pass to merge):
1. `cargo nextest run --no-default-features --features parallel,disk-persistence` green.
2. `cargo clippy --all --all-targets --no-default-features -- -D warnings` clean — **no new `#[allow(dead_code)]`**; if the strip orphans an item, delete it.
3. For PRs **4a–4e only:** golden digests in `transparent_proof_golden.rs` unchanged and verify-side golden green. **4f explicitly deletes that test.**
4. The PR's "driven to 0" crate(s) report `git grep -c 'feature = "zk"' -- 'crates/<crate>/src/**/*.rs'` = **0** (4e: global, including tests/examples/Cargo).
5. Net-negative LOC modulo the verify-side test; no new abstractions, shims, renames, or transparent-logic edits.

Escalation rule for the implementing agent: if a deletion is not one of the five
mechanical patterns (lone-cfg, paired-arm, `cfg_if!`, cfg-param, cfg-field) — e.g.
removing a zk param leaves a `not(zk)` value undefined, or a symbol is referenced
by *non*-cfg code — **stop and report the file:line** rather than writing new
logic. The strip is purely subtractive; anything that requires authoring protocol
logic is a sign the arms were not cleanly paired and needs human review.

*Verify (whole slice 4):* I1/I2 are most at risk in the fold-replay PRs (4b/4d) —
gate PRs 4a–4e on the golden digest + full transparent e2e. Run `--features zk` once
*before* 4a to confirm the pre-strip feature still built historically; do **not**
expect it after.

**Slice 4f — Retire golden tripwire.** ⏳ *After 4e merges*
- Delete `crates/akita-pcs/tests/transparent_proof_golden.rs` and retire golden
  references in book/spec docs.
- **Merge policy:** land 4f as its own PR **after** the zk-strip stack (4a–4e).
  Collapsing 4a–4e into fewer PRs is fine; **do not** fold 4f into that stack.
- *Verify:* default test run green without the golden test; e2e serde roundtrips
  remain the ongoing wire regression gate.

**Optional merges (Q1):** 4a+4b may merge if verifier review bandwidth allows;
4c+4d may merge if you'd rather review the prover as one unit (both touch only
`akita-prover`/sizing). Do **not** fold the prover PRs into the schema PR (4e) —
deleting the proof-type fields while a producer/consumer still references them
reintroduces the dangling-reference window OI-2 avoids.

After 4e: `cargo check --features zk` **errors** (the feature is gone) and
`rg 'feature = "zk"' crates/` returns nothing in crate code — the audit-clean
end state for the transparent product. Pre-strip umbrella specs may still mention
retired `zk` paths until archived separately.
After 4f: pinned proof-byte digests are no longer a merge gate; protocol wire
format may evolve without re-pinning SHA-256 constants in CI.

#### Survives-complete (un-gate only, no completion work)

The tiered/recursive setup engine and the SegmentTyped terminal witness stack are
gated on **runtime** ring-dimension/`tier_split`, *orthogonal* to `zk`; the
`fp32`/`fp128` non-zk arms are the live path. `PackedDigits` was removed in 4e
(schema unification). `schedule_terminal_direct_witness_shape` is unconditional
`SegmentTyped`.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **`akita-zk-prefix` plugin crate with hook/trait dependency-inversion**
   (the prior council's Phase 2). **Rejected.** ZK is baked into the proof wire
   format (`AkitaBatchedProof.zk_hiding`) and the compute traits (`zk_b_digit_rows`
   are cfg-gated *methods* on `DigitRowsComputeBackend`, which a plugin cannot
   extend from outside Rust). A plugin needs `OperationCtx`/`RootCommitKernel`/proof
   types, so it must depend on `akita-prover`/`akita-types`; core calling into it
   creates a Cargo **cycle**. Making it work first requires inverting three core
   abstractions (backend kernel methods → standalone trait, setup matrices →
   optional extension, `zk_hiding` field → `Option`). Worse, the roadmap
   (`zero-knowledge.md:14-21`) says finished-ZK *replaces* the plain-opening prefix
   with the `sec:zk-joint-sigma` seam + suffix modulus switching + LNP22 — the very
   structures the hook would freeze. Net: high cost, ossifies the wrong boundary,
   discarded post-seam.

2. **In-tree `protocol/zk/` submodule relocation.** **Rejected as insufficient.**
   Moving the *bodies* (`ZkHidingProverState`, `build_zk_hiding_context`, masking)
   into a skippable `protocol/zk/` declutters `core.rs`, but the cfg-gated
   *parameters*, *struct fields*, and `+ mask` *branches* live inside the shared
   `prove_fold`/`PreparedFold` and **cannot move** — the auditor still reads ZK in
   `fold.rs`/`wire.rs`/`levels.rs`. A genuine partial win, but it does not meet
   "zero ZK in the auditor's path." Kept as the fallback if continuous
   `--features zk` buildability is later judged more important than a fully clean
   read.

3. **Snapshot / cfg-strip tarball.** Leave `main` as-is; a CI/script pass strips
   `#[cfg(feature="zk")]` to hand the auditor a generated ZK-free tree.
   **Rejected as primary** because the audited artifact would be a generated
   derivative that can drift from the repo of record; teams generally prefer the
   audited tree to be the real `main`. Viable as a stopgap if the strip cannot land
   before the audit window.

4. **Keep B/D blinding as an always-on "hiding commitment."** **Rejected.** The
   blinding changes committed bytes and is inert without the zk-only setup matrices
   + proof fields to discharge it; it is not a standalone hiding primitive. Only the
   LHL *sizing math* is genuinely generic.

## Documentation

- Update [`book/src/roadmap/zero-knowledge.md`](../book/src/roadmap/zero-knowledge.md):
  note that the ZK prefix is now off `main` on `zk-wip` (tag
  `zk-prefix-snapshot-2026-06`), to be reintroduced atop the finished seam.
- Update [`book/src/usage/feature-flags.md`](../book/src/usage/feature-flags.md):
  remove the `zk` feature row.
- Set `Status: superseded` (or add a banner) on the prefix-ZK design specs
  [`archive/2026-Q2/akita-zk-sumcheck-hiding-plain.md`](archive/2026-Q2/akita-zk-sumcheck-hiding-plain.md),
  [`archive/2026-Q2/akita-zk-commitment-hiding.md`](archive/2026-Q2/akita-zk-commitment-hiding.md),
  [`archive/2026-Q2/akita-zk-v-hiding.md`](archive/2026-Q2/akita-zk-v-hiding.md): mark them out of audit scope,
  retained as the design record for the `zk-wip` work.
- Add an audit-contract note: the transparent path is the product under review;
  `zk` is not built, `akita-r1cs` is absent, and `ProtocolFeatureSet.zk == false`.
- Update `AGENTS.md` / `Cargo.toml` comments referencing the `zk` feature.

## Open Questions

1. **`lhl_blinding` on `main` vs branch.** This spec keeps the pure LHL math
   always-on (honoring "keep generic infra standalone"). The alternative is to send
   `zk.rs` to `zk-wip` too, leaving `main` with *zero* zk-adjacent code — cleanest
   auditor view, but contradicts the stated "keep generic infra standalone."
   Recommended default: keep `lhl_blinding` with the doc note; revisit if the
   auditor flags unreferenced code.
2. **`PackedDigits` dead type** after the prover fold-replay PR (4d) — delete now
   (extra reconciliation) or leave as a flagged follow-up? Recommended: follow-up,
   to keep 4d focused.
3. **`zk-wip` maintenance.** Since finished-ZK is largely a rewrite, treat the
   branch as a *frozen reference* (do not continuously rebase onto `main`). Confirm
   this is acceptable vs. periodic rebase.
