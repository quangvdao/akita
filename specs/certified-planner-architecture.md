The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**,
**SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **NOT RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and
**OPTIONAL** in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

## Summary

Akita needs one offline planner whose result is exact under an explicit policy
and whose normal execution is fast. The planner must not choose between a
small heuristic search and a second exhaustive fallback. It must search one
audited decision domain, use guidance to visit strong candidates early, and
remove unexplored regions only through checked proofs of irrelevance.

This specification defines that architecture. It separates the candidate
language from traversal order, feasibility from progress, and local scoring
from the complete schedule objective. It defines a diagnostic oracle and a
guided execution as two settings of the same search engine. An expensive
oracle run may produce versioned guidance, but the guided run must still prove
that its selected schedule is optimal.

The supporting pruning proof file states the first concrete theorems for that
result. It derives an exact mandatory recursive witness body, an incumbent
interval for split search, an admissible relaxed suffix search, and transition
dominance rules. It also gives separate proof contracts for selective L2
routes and setup first slice choices. Those two current restrictions must be
removed or certified in later implementation pull requests.

This specification is stacked on the planner and protocol state established by
#445. In particular, quotient lift versus reduced evaluation is already an
independent, authenticated, monotone planner decision; the complete objective
already compares the root output-witness length after its policy coordinates;
and small independent oracle paths already cover complete relation cutovers and
unpruned recursive candidates. The target architecture must preserve and reuse
those foundations rather than introduce parallel replacements.

The specification also replaces the narrow semantic model of one main group
plus precommitted groups. A commitment workload may contain several semantic
groups, several commitment epochs separated by transcript challenges, and one
or more shared opening batches. Each group owns its source and extraction
contract. The opening batch separately identifies the group that closes the
current grouped root. That closing group is algebraically new, but it is not
the semantic main witness.

Aerie Falcon version 1 is the main integration case. It commits five groups
before the JL seed and three JL digit groups after the seed, then opens all
eight together. Its adopted post-seed order is `JlTwo`, `JlOne`, then
`JlFour`. `JlFour` closes the current Akita batch because the selected lowering
commits it last. The planner must jointly price the complete workload without
calling that shard the main route or allowing its source family to own the
shared opening policy.

All planning remains offline. The planner emits a compact complete plan which
`akita-schedules` expands and validates. Runtime setup, commitment, proving,
and verification consume an approved generated catalog row. Runtime code never
invokes planner search or trusts a planner cost estimate.

## Current baseline and unresolved problems

The target architecture starts from several settled changes.

1. [PR #408](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/akita/pull/408) replaced the
   contractive root attempt and noncontractive fallback with one root search.
   Root contraction is not an admission rule or objective coordinate.
2. [PR #416](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/akita/pull/416) consolidated
   schedule parameters and removed several duplicate representations.
3. [`setup-offloading-planner.md`](setup-offloading-planner.md) defines the
   current recursive setup offload semantics and setup first objective.
4. [`heterogeneous-group-source-contracts.md`](heterogeneous-group-source-contracts.md)
   defines group owned honest fold sizing while keeping runtime profiles free
   of source identity.
5. Generated catalogs, rather than planner execution, remain the runtime path.
6. [PR #445](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/akita/pull/445) added the
   authenticated `RingRelationMode`, a monotone quotient-prefix to
   reduced-evaluation-suffix state machine, exact relation-transition
   enumeration, an independent cutover oracle, traversal-order invariance
   tests, and generated replay of the selected relation modes.
7. PR #445 also versioned the complete selection policies so the root output
   witness is compared after the existing numeric policy coordinates and
   before the canonical descriptor. It added complete-source compression-plan
   reuse, response-model reuse, setup-prefix search reuse, and bounded exact
   suffix memoization. Those caches are accelerators, not search authorities.
8. The current test support has an unpruned recursive candidate enumerator. It
   scans every split and derives Linf and eligible selective-L2 candidates
   independently of the production split walker. The production and reference
   paths still share materializers rather than one search orchestrator.

The remaining problems concern the meaning and proof of the search.

### Search policy still changes the candidate language

`RecursiveSplitSearchPolicy::BoundedBalancedExtremesV1` searches the two split
extremes and a fixed radius around a balance estimate when the variable count
is large. The omitted splits are not currently excluded by a proof that they
cannot win the complete objective. Root totality therefore holds only within
this configured split domain.

Selective L2 planning currently derives candidates from the split selected by
the best modeled Linf candidate for each admitted relation mode. Some levels
retain a split frontier while others keep a local best candidate according to
level and policy conditions. Each choice may be useful, but the code does not
give every omission a common proof contract.

Slice 1 removed the setup-first minimum-local-setup shortcut. Root, recursive
Linf, and recursive selective-L2 generation now retain every feasible slice
through successor sizing and complete suffix pricing. A later certified slice
frontier may recover performance, but local setup alone is no longer a search
authority.

There is no theorem which says that the best L2 route uses the best Linf split.
The audited domain must include the other L2 splits until a checked certificate
covers their complete objective effect.

### Reference and production search remain separate

The independent recursive and relation-cutover oracles added by #445 are
meaningful correctness checks: they enumerate every split or every monotone
cutover and compare the complete objective and descriptor. They are not yet an
execution mode of the production suffix engine. The target architecture must
converge production and oracle execution on the same decision enumerators,
transition materializer, selector, and frontier semantics while retaining an
independent test oracle for the highest-risk relation cutover law.

### Local and global choices remain mixed

Candidate generation applies local scoring, successor progress, slice
selection, security route selection, and frontier retention in the same call
chain. A local winner can be globally inferior when it changes the next
witness, the first direct setup capacity, a later security route, or the
canonical descriptor.

The planner must state which choices are exact domain definitions and which
are traversal hints. It must also state which local dominance rules are valid
for every possible suffix consumer.

### Group planning begins after earlier profiles are frozen

`AkitaScheduleLookupKey` receives one final group layout and exact profiles for
earlier groups. This is the correct lookup shape for an already compiled batch,
but it is too late for joint planning. The planner cannot compare alternative
commitment recipes for the earlier groups once those profiles are part of the
input key.

[PR #409](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/akita/pull/409) explores exact
precommit profile planning. [PR #412](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/akita/pull/412)
explores symmetry reduction and streamed grouped root search. This
specification keeps those design goals but places them inside a wider workload
contract.

### Planner performance is not yet a contract

The repository checks catalog drift, but it does not yet define a supported
fast search setting, a guide artifact, or per fixture time and memory budgets.
An implementation can remain exact and still be unusable for iterative
schedule work. It can also become fast by silently narrowing the domain.
Neither outcome is acceptable. Exact generated rows, relation cutovers,
witness lengths, and proof-byte totals are outputs, not compatibility
fixtures; performance evidence must measure the engine without freezing those
choices into a second protocol contract.

## Intent

### Goal

Build one exact offline planner that searches a complete audited decision
domain, supports phased heterogeneous commitment workloads, uses certified
guidance for a fast normal execution, and emits one deterministic validated
plan under an explicit complete schedule objective.

### Invariants

#### Search meaning

1. The planner **MUST** have one semantic search path.
2. Oracle and guided executions **MUST** use the same request normalization,
   decision enumerators, candidate materializer, objective, frontier rules,
   descriptor ordering, and output validator.
3. Guidance **MAY** change traversal order and provide an incumbent.
4. Guidance **MUST NOT** remove a candidate unless a checked certificate proves
   that the candidate cannot change the selected complete schedule.
5. A missing bound, arithmetic overflow in a bound, unsupported certificate,
   or stale guide **MUST** retain the affected candidate.
6. The selected result **MUST** be independent of traversal order, parallel
   execution, batching, memo capacity, and cache eviction.
7. `UnsupportedSchedule` **MUST** mean that the audited domain contains no
   complete feasible schedule. It **MUST NOT** mean that a fast subset found no
   schedule.
8. The monotone ring-relation transition authority from #445 **MUST** remain
   the only definition of quotient-prefix and reduced-evaluation-suffix
   eligibility. Oracle, guided, and generated replay paths **MUST** call it
   directly.

#### Objective and frontier meaning

1. Every selection policy **MUST** define one total order on complete
   schedules, including the canonical descriptor tie break.
2. Every partial frontier **MUST** name the future observations that justify
   each retained coordinate.
3. A dominance rule **MUST** prove irrelevance for every parent or suffix that
   can consume the dominated candidate.
4. A local layout score **MUST NOT** be used as a complete schedule lower bound
   unless the missing suffix and parent costs are proven nonnegative and
   independent in the required order.
5. Memo eviction **MAY** cause recomputation. It **MUST NOT** change frontier
   contents or the final result.
6. The root output-witness length **MUST** follow every policy-specific numeric
   coordinate and precede the canonical descriptor. A frontier or lower bound
   which omits it **MUST** retain equality on all earlier coordinates.

#### Security and arithmetic

1. Candidate materialization **MUST** use the same role typed security,
   sizing, and layout primitives that `akita-schedules` uses to validate an
   expanded row.
2. Generic checked `usize` arithmetic **MUST** use `akita_error::checked`.
   Planner modules **MUST NOT** introduce local checked product, sum, range,
   alignment, division, or power of two helpers.
3. A recursive state **MUST** retain every value needed to price and certify a
   future transition. This includes the predecessor response basis and any
   source moment or energy class used by a later security route.
4. A planner **MUST NOT** replace a certified rank, norm route, or digit basis
   with a locally smaller value before all later consumers have been priced.
5. Security route selection **MUST** be part of the audited decision domain or
   have a proof that an omitted route cannot win.

#### Commitment workloads

1. A group semantic role, source contract, commitment epoch, and grouped root
   role **MUST** be separate fields or separate derived concepts.
2. A group which closes a batch **MUST NOT** be described as the semantic main
   group unless the application independently assigns that role.
3. The shared opening policy **MUST** be selected explicitly for the batch. It
   **MUST NOT** be inferred from the source family of the closing group.
4. The planner **MUST** jointly compare every group commitment plan and the
   shared opening whenever those choices can affect the complete objective.
5. The protocol supplied epoch order and challenge boundaries **MUST** be
   preserved. The planner **MUST NOT** reorder groups across a transcript
   challenge.
6. Any schedule or source bound choice that affects extraction or verifier
   behavior **MUST** be publicly bound before the first commitment whose
   meaning depends on that choice.

#### Performance

1. The guided execution **MUST** be the supported normal planner execution.
2. At least one supported exact path **MUST** meet the time and memory budgets
   in this specification without reducing the audited decision domain.
3. The oracle **MAY** be expensive, but it **MUST** remain available for small
   domains, scheduled audits, new guide generation, and focused high pressure
   fixtures.
4. Every performance result **MUST** report compile exclusion, machine details,
   thread count, peak resident memory, guide identity, domain identity, and
   selected schedule identity.
5. The guided and oracle results **MUST** agree exactly on every fixture where
   the oracle is run.

#### Runtime boundary

1. No planner crate or search function **MAY** be verifier reachable.
2. Planner estimates **MUST NOT** enter proof bytes, transcript state, or
   verifier acceptance.
3. Every emitted plan **MUST** expand and validate through `akita-schedules`
   before publication.
4. Runtime catalog trust, versioned artifact loading, and row authentication
   are consumer contracts. They are not alternate planner algorithms.
5. Planner guides, diagnostics, and benchmark reports **MUST NOT** become
   verifier inputs or compatibility authorities for exact generated rows.

### Non-goals

This specification does not change the Akita proof equations.

This specification does not change the current setup offload feasibility or
contraction rules. It gives those rules a clearer transition and pruning
boundary.

This specification does not move source identity into commitments, proofs, or
runtime schedule keys. Source laws remain offline group policy inputs.

This specification does not require the production planner to evaluate every
materialized candidate. It requires the planner to account for the complete
audited domain through evaluation, exact equivalence, or certified pruning.

This specification does not define an arbitrary dependency graph for protocol
execution. Ordered commitment epochs cover the current Fiat-Shamir use cases.
A later protocol may extend the workload model if ordered epochs are
insufficient.

This specification does not permit empirical observations to prove candidate
irrelevance. Empirical observations may choose traversal order. A mathematical
or exact structural argument must justify pruning.

This specification does not require one universal objective for every Akita
application. It requires every policy to define one complete deterministic
order and every catalog to bind its policy identity.

This specification does not require checked-in golden catalogs, cutover
snapshots, or exact schedule evidence. Generated tables remain validated
runtime inputs, but tests of planner semantics compare canonical objectives,
descriptors, expansion, and independent-oracle agreement rather than freezing
today's selected rows.

This specification does not make the planner a runtime service. Applications
continue to consume generated schedules.

## Terminology

An **audited decision domain** is the complete finite set of independent
choices admitted by a versioned planner policy.

A **decision** contains independent choices such as a split, basis, ring
dimension, opening method, security route, slice count, or setup offload edge.

A **materialized candidate** is the exact typed schedule fragment derived from
a decision by canonical arithmetic and security functions.

A **feasible candidate** satisfies protocol geometry, security, setup, and
resource constraints.

**Progress** is a transition property. A recursive fold progresses when its
successor satisfies the required witness contraction. Root contraction is not
a feasibility rule.

A **complete schedule** contains the root, every recursive fold, and the
terminal response.

A **ring-relation phase** is the monotone planner state introduced by #445.
It is either a quotient prefix or a reduced-evaluation suffix. The public
per-fold decision remains the authenticated `RingRelationMode` in
`CommittedGroupParams`.

A **guide** is a versioned offline artifact that provides candidate ordering,
an incumbent, and optional certified exclusions.

The **oracle execution** disables optional certified pruning and explores the
complete audited domain through the shared engine.

The **guided execution** uses a guide and every available certified bound to
prove the same optimum with less work.

A **pruning certificate** is a checked argument that a candidate or region
cannot improve the complete schedule total order.

A **frontier** is a set of partial schedules that remain distinguishable to a
future consumer.

A **commitment epoch** is an ordered set of groups whose values are available
and whose commitments are absorbed before the next named transcript challenge.

A **closing group** is the new group whose commitment parameters complete one
grouped root after the prior group profiles are fixed. It is an algebraic and
temporal role, not a semantic role.

A **frozen group** is an earlier committed group whose exact commitment profile
cannot be changed by the grouped root planner.

A **batch opening policy** owns the shared root and recursive opening choices
for a group batch. It is separate from every individual group source contract.

```

The exact Rust module names are not normative. The ownership boundaries are.

### Component responsibilities

Request normalization owns default removal, policy validation, stable ordering,
and construction of the finite audited domain.

Decision enumerators own independent choices. They do not compute a suffix
objective or retain a local winner.

Candidate materialization owns derived widths, ranks, bounds, matrices,
witness lengths, setup requirements, proof byte estimates, and typed
rejections. It calls canonical shared primitives directly.

The bound library owns admissible lower bounds and exact equivalence proofs.
It does not own candidate enumeration.

The search orchestrator owns traversal order, work queues, batching, incumbent
management, and memo use. It does not redefine feasibility or objectives.

The frontier engine owns consumer projections and dominance. It does not
reconstruct protocol parameters.

The selector owns the total order on complete schedules.

The emitter owns compact plan serialization for generated source and diagnostic
reports. It does not authorize runtime use.

`akita-schedules` owns expansion, canonical validation, and runtime schedule
identity.

### One canonical function per concept

The implementation **MUST** keep one canonical function for each decision
domain, derived quantity, objective, descriptor, and validation rule. A type
method may assemble its fields into that function. Thin aliases which only
recompose an existing API are forbidden.

Shared code means shared arithmetic, materialization, and validation. It does
not mean one large candidate builder with optional fields for every planner
mode.

## Formal planning model

Let (R) be a normalized request and (S) a planner state. Let
(mathcal D(R,S)) be the finite decision domain at that state. Materialization
maps one decision to a transition or a typed rejection:

\[
M(R,S,d) \rightarrow T \;\text{or}\; E,
\qquad d\in\mathcal D(R,S).
\]

A transition contains its exact current cost, successor state, parent visible
geometry, and compact decision. A complete path through transitions forms a
schedule (C).

Let (mathcal C(R)) be every complete feasible schedule in the audited domain.
For the configured total objective (O_R), the planner contract is:

\[
\operatorname{plan}(R)
=
\arg\min_{C\in\mathcal C(R)} O_R(C).
\]

The descriptor tie break is part of (O_R). Enumeration order is not.

If (mathcal C(R)) is empty, planning returns `UnsupportedSchedule` with
diagnostics that report the typed rejection counts. If the domain itself is
invalid, normalization returns the corresponding input or policy error before
search begins.

### Feasibility, progress, objective, and traversal

These four concepts must remain separate.

Feasibility asks whether a candidate satisfies protocol and resource rules.

Progress asks whether a recursive successor contracts enough for the selected
edge. The root may be noncontractive.

The objective compares complete feasible schedules.

Traversal decides which still possible schedule is examined first.

No Boolean such as `contractive_path`, `fast_mode`, or `fallback_mode` may
select a second planner implementation.

## Decision language and canonical materialization

### Independent decisions

The audited domain must explicitly cover every independent choice which may
change the selected complete plan.

For a root or recursive fold, this includes as applicable:

- block split;
- A source basis;
- response and opening basis;
- A, B, and D ring dimensions;
- opening method and its challenge configuration;
- commitment slice count;
- payload mode;
- witness chunk layout;
- honest fold policy result;
- Linf or L2 security route;
- quotient lift or reduced evaluation where the current relation phase and
  fold topology admit both;
- setup prefix edge and exact prefix geometry;
- terminal strategy;
- commitment group profile choice;
- commitment epoch and closing group where the protocol permits a choice.

The protocol or catalog policy may fix any coordinate to a singleton domain.
A fixed coordinate is still documented as part of the domain identity.

### Derived values

The following values are derived and must not become independent knobs:

- digit counts implied by a source contract and basis;
- accepted balanced digit ranges;
- source and response norm bounds;
- matrix input widths and minimum secure ranks;
- physical segment widths;
- commitment and opening payload bytes;
- next witness length;
- setup field requirements;
- contraction status;
- next ring-relation phase and whether setup offload remains legal;
- proof shape and proof byte estimate;
- parent observable geometry;
- canonical descriptor bytes.

A compact generated plan may store some derived values for stable source
generation. Expansion must recompute or validate them through the canonical
owner. No unchecked duplicate becomes authoritative.

### State sufficiency

A memo key must contain every fact that can change future feasibility, pricing,
or descriptor order. It must not contain values which cannot affect a future
consumer.

In particular, recursive state must preserve:

- current level and witness length;
- source basis inherited from the preceding response;
- any source moment or certified energy class used by response modeling;
- incoming setup prefix state;
- active ring dimensions or their admissible ceiling;
- payload phase;
- ring-relation phase;
- workload and policy identities needed by later materialization.

The state may use a stable compact identity for large immutable workload data.

### Typed rejection

Candidate materialization returns typed planner rejections. The initial set
should distinguish at least:

```text
InvalidGeometry
ArithmeticOverflow
InsufficientSetup
InsecureSis
UnsupportedOpeningMethod
UnsupportedChunkLayout
NoRecursiveProgress
InvalidSetupPrefixEdge
InvalidRelationTransition
UnavailableSecurityRoute
TerminalUnavailable
WorkloadOrderViolation
InvalidGuideCertificate
```

Diagnostics may add structured context such as level, group, split, basis, or
dimension. Planner logic must not branch on error message strings.

## Phased commitment workloads

### Why the existing key is not enough

`AkitaScheduleLookupKey` is a compiled lookup key. It contains one new group
layout and exact frozen profiles for every prior group. It remains useful after
planning, but it cannot express the joint search that chooses those profiles.

The planner therefore needs a request which exists before any individual group
recipe is frozen.

### Conceptual request

The intended information content is:

```text
CommitmentWorkload
    groups: ordered GroupRequirement list
    epochs: ordered CommitmentEpoch list
    opening_batches: OpeningBatchRequirement list
    batch_opening_policy
    selection_policy

GroupRequirement
    id
    semantic_label
    logical_layout
    source_contract
    allowed_commitment_policy
    epoch

CommitmentEpoch
    ordered_group_ids
    challenge_after_epoch

OpeningBatchRequirement
    ordered_group_ids
    closing_group_id
    reorder_policy
```

The final Rust types may differ. The separation of information is normative.

`semantic_label` is for protocol review and diagnostics. Core planner decisions
must use the layout and source contract, not a match on an application name.

`source_contract` selects the offline honest fold policy and the declared
extraction requirements. Runtime profiles remain source free as required by
[`heterogeneous-group-source-contracts.md`](heterogeneous-group-source-contracts.md).

`epoch` states when the witness values exist and where their commitment is
absorbed. It does not select a commitment profile.

`closing_group_id` names the group which is new when the grouped root is
formed. Every other group in that opening batch is frozen at that point.

`batch_opening_policy` owns the shared opening and recursion policy. It is not
copied from the closing group configuration.

### Ordered epochs

Each epoch contains groups whose commitments may be computed in parallel after
their values become available. Their payloads are absorbed in the exact order
given by the epoch.

If an epoch produces a challenge, every earlier group profile, schedule choice,
and commitment payload required by that challenge must already be bound. A
later epoch may depend on that challenge.

The planner may compare alternative group orders only when `reorder_policy`
explicitly permits them. It may never move a group across a challenge boundary
without a protocol revision.

### Aerie Falcon version 1 reference workload

The exact workload is defined in
[Aerie Falcon v1 Workload](certified-planner/aerie-workload.md). That
supporting file is pinned to Aerie commit
`e102ee371d08770b6fdfcebc33abe169e60e2756` and reconciles the protocol
document with the adopted JL4-final implementation.

The planner sees two commitment epochs and one eight group opening batch. The
first epoch commits `S1`, `Epsilon`, `S2SourcesFour`, `BudgetTwo`, and
`BudgetOne`, then derives the JL seed. The second epoch commits `JlTwo`,
`JlOne`, and `JlFour` in that order. The compiled Akita key freezes the first
seven profiles and uses `JlFour` as its closing group.

The JL shard names describe how many digit planes they contain. They do not
describe commitment position or semantic importance. `JlFour` closes the
Akita batch because the adopted implementation places it last after a measured
schedule comparison. It is not the main witness, and its bound 6 source family
does not own the shared opening policy.

The seed determines the JL digit values. It does not determine their group
shapes, source contracts, transcript positions, or selected schedules. The
complete plan can and must therefore be selected and bound before the first
commitment.


### Joint group profile planning

For each group requirement, the planner enumerates a local set of secure exact
commitment profiles. It then compares combinations through the complete batch
opening objective.

A local profile may be removed only when it is dominated for every opening
batch and policy which can consume that group. A locally larger profile may
win globally if it reduces the grouped root witness, a later fold, total setup,
or the canonical schedule descriptor.

The implementation must stream group profile combinations into the root
frontier. It must not materialize the full Cartesian product.

Groups with identical requirements and exchangeable transcript positions may
use a multiset domain. The symmetry proof must show that omitted permutations
have identical feasibility, cost, parent observations, and descriptor handling.
If transcript order distinguishes two groups, they are not exchangeable.

### Compiled lookup and execution plan

After joint planning, the selected profiles compile to the exact ordered batch
profile needed by runtime lookup and commitment execution.

The output must distinguish:

```text
GroupCommitPlan
    group id
    exact committed profile
    epoch and absorb position

BatchOpeningPlan
    ordered group ids
    closing group id
    exact fold schedule
    catalog and row identity
```

The current `final_group` and `precommitteds` representation may remain inside
the compiled runtime schedule while the implementation migrates. Planner APIs
and diagnostics should use `closing_group`, `new_group`, `frozen_groups`, or
`prior_groups` according to the exact role. `main_group` is forbidden when the
code means only the new or last group.

## Candidate domains

### Domain identity

Every catalog binds a stable identity for the complete candidate language.
The identity includes:

- basis ranges;
- split domain version;
- ring dimension domain;
- opening method domain;
- slice and payload domains;
- source policy identities;
- security route domain;
- setup offload policy;
- terminal strategies;
- workload reorder policy;
- objective policy;
- security table and modulus profile identities.

A guide is valid only for the exact domain identity or for a declared region
whose validity predicate accepts that domain.

### Root decisions

Root candidate enumeration must cover every split in the audited root split
domain. Root contraction may order candidates but may not admit or reject them.
The root enumerator must materialize both contractive and noncontractive
candidates through the same suffix search.

A bounded root split domain is acceptable only if the policy declares that
domain as an approximation, or if every excluded split has a checked optimality
certificate. Production exact catalogs must use the second choice.

### Recursive decisions

Recursive folds require strict progress under the active successor policy.
Progress is checked after exact witness materialization or through a
conservative lower bound that proves progress impossible.

The production planner must account for every recursive split in the audited
domain. A balance estimate and fixed radius may seed traversal, but they cannot
define an exact domain without a proof.

### Basis and dimension decisions

The A source basis and response basis remain independent coordinates where the
policy permits both. A balanced recursive source uses the basis which produced
it and is not decomposed again under a new A basis.

Dimension domains come only from `RingDimensionScheduleMode`. A guide may order
dimension tuples. It may exclude a tuple only through a complete feasibility or
objective certificate.

### Security route decisions

Linf and selective L2 routes are independent candidate routes when both are
eligible. An L2 route may reuse a split selected under Linf only if a proof
shows that no other L2 split can win the complete objective.

The production search must first apply geometry and witness bounds which do not
depend on the security route. It must then evaluate every eligible route for
every surviving split cell. A complete route dominance certificate may remove
a route from a region. The split chosen by another route is never a route
domain definition.

The route decision carries its source moment or energy class through every DP
state which may price a later witness. The selected route fixes exact verifier
visible bounds and ranks in the emitted schedule. Runtime expansion never
reruns the response model.

### Ring-relation decisions

The canonical relation-transition authority from #445 defines the complete
domain for one fold from the absolute fold level, incoming setup-prefix
topology, opening method, and current `RingRelationPhase`. In a quotient
prefix it admits quotient lift and, from level 2 onward on a direct
`EvaluationTrace` edge, reduced evaluation. In a reduced-evaluation suffix it
admits only another direct reduced-evaluation fold. It never admits a return to
quotient lifting or a later setup prefix.

Relation mode is independent of payload phase, split, dimensions, slice count,
and Linf versus selective L2 wherever the feature matrix permits their
combination. An enumerator may share geometry work before witness layouts
diverge, but it must retain the typed `RelationTransition`; mode alone is not a
sufficient transition token because the next phase and setup-offload
eligibility are part of the consequence.

The independent monotone-cutover oracle remains a required test authority even
after oracle and guided executions share the production engine. It enumerates
the `m + 1` legal cutovers for a fixed skeleton and detects accidental
oscillation or omission in that engine.

### Slice decisions

Slice candidates must remain until exact future irrelevance is established.
For setup first selection, choosing the smallest local padded setup and then
the smallest slice count is not sufficient by itself. The proof must cover the
next witness, suffix proof, total setup envelope, and descriptor order.

The current slice domain has four values, 1, 2, 4, and 8. The planner should
materialize their cheap transition signatures before it starts suffix search.
It may retain every signature which is not worse on all relevant coordinates.
It may remove a slice only when the transition dominance theorem in the proof
addendum applies.

### Setup offload decisions

The direct and offloaded forms are transitions in one recursive domain. Local
prefix geometry may use a canonical local minimizer only when the setup
offloading contract proves that every other local geometry is irrelevant to
the global suffix. The decision whether to offload remains global.

### Terminal decisions

Every state which may legally terminate must enumerate its terminal routes.
The planner compares termination with another fold through the complete
objective. A terminal candidate does not require an unused successor witness
to contract.

## Complete objectives and frontiers

### Current complete orders

This architecture preserves the current complete schedule orders until a
separate policy revision changes them.

`MinEstimatedProofPayloadV2` uses:

```text
(proof bytes,
 total setup field elements,
 root output-witness length,
 canonical descriptor)
```

`MinFirstDirectSetupThenPayloadV2` uses:

```text
(first direct padded setup capacity,
 proof bytes,
 total setup field elements,
 root output-witness length,
 canonical descriptor)
```

The descriptor is compared only after all numeric coordinates, including the
root output-witness length, tie.

If joint commitment profile planning needs commitment payload bytes in the
objective, the policy must add that coordinate explicitly and change its
identity. The planner must not silently reinterpret `proof bytes`.

### Parent observations

A partial suffix may be merged with another only when every possible parent
observes them as equivalent or prefers one under the complete order.

The frontier contract must list:

- the exact parent visible key;
- admission classes such as required fold depth and setup capacity;
- numeric projections used by each selection policy;
- descriptor context needed when numeric coordinates tie;
- the proof that a discarded candidate cannot win for any parent.

No frontier coordinate may remain merely because it once affected an older
planner. No parent visible value may be omitted merely because it does not
affect the current local score.

### Complete lower bounds

A lower bound used to prune a partial schedule must be a prefix of the same
lexicographic objective used for complete selection. It may omit the root
output-witness length only when an earlier policy coordinate is already
strictly worse. It may omit the descriptor only when pruning establishes
strict numeric inferiority before the descriptor.

Equal numeric lower bounds cannot prune because an unvisited schedule may win
the canonical descriptor tie break.

## One search engine

### Shared semantics

The planner has one work queue and one candidate materialization path. The
engine accepts an execution configuration which controls optional certificates,
diagnostics, and guide use. It does not select a different planner.

Conceptually:

```text
normalize request
load and validate optional guide
seed incumbent from guide if feasible
enqueue the complete audited region
while work remains:
    take the region with the best priority
    if a checked bound is strictly worse than the incumbent:
        record the certificate and discard the region
    else if the region is splittable:
        refine it and enqueue its children
    else:
        materialize candidates and update exact frontiers
select the best complete schedule
expand and validate the plan
```

Priority may use empirical models. Discarding work may not.

### Oracle execution

The oracle uses the same engine with optional pruning disabled. Exact
equivalence reductions which define the audited domain, such as a proved
symmetry quotient, remain enabled.

The oracle must support:

- exhaustive small domains in ordinary tests;
- focused full split scans for named recursive states;
- focused group profile products;
- scheduled high pressure fixture runs;
- guide generation and guide audits.

The oracle output includes the selected plan, complete objective, runner up
gap, domain counts, and a stable trace digest.

### Guided execution

The guided execution is the default for catalog generation. It uses:

- a known feasible incumbent;
- preferred decision order;
- certified feasible intervals;
- certified impossible intervals;
- symmetry classes;
- complete objective lower bounds;
- cached exact local profile frontiers.

The guide may identify the schedule found by a previous oracle run. That makes
the incumbent available immediately. Fast completion still requires the engine
to certify every remaining region as worse or equivalent.

There is no restart after a guide miss. An invalid incumbent is rejected and
the same queue continues. An invalid optional exclusion is ignored and the
region remains queued. The diagnostic report records each ignored guide item.

### Guide artifact

A guide artifact must contain:

```text
format version
planner domain identity
objective identity
security table identity
workload region predicate
incumbent compact plan
ordering hints
certified exclusions
generator revision and evidence reference
guide digest
```

The guide is a disposable planner accelerator, not a catalog or protocol
artifact. Its incumbent and exclusions are revalidated under the bound domain
before use. Deleting a guide may increase work but cannot change the selected
schedule; changing only ordering hints cannot change catalog identity or row
identity. A repository test must not assert the exact schedule stored in a
guide as a compatibility snapshot.

Ordering hints may be broad and empirical. Certified exclusions must name a
checker implemented by the bound library and contain only the data needed by
that checker.

The planner must validate the incumbent as if it had just materialized it. The
planner must validate every exclusion before using it. The guide is not a
trusted proof system input.

A guide for one exact catalog row may use an equality region predicate. A
guide intended for nearby rows must state checked ranges for every workload
coordinate on which its certificates depend.

## Certified pruning

Detailed rule contracts and proofs live in
[Certified Planner Pruning Proofs](certified-planner/pruning-proofs.md). That
supporting file is normative and inherits this specification's lifecycle.

A pruning rule has authority only through a checked mathematical certificate.
Every rule states its domain, exact predicate, bounded objective coordinate,
proof, conservative unknown behavior, oracle comparison, and diagnostics. A
guide may order work freely. It may exclude work only by supplying data for one
of these checked rules.

The first rigorous split result applies inside an exact cell where ranks, digit
depths, compression choices, and relation geometry are fixed. The mandatory Z,
E, and T body is

\[
F(p)=a\left\lceil\frac{N}{2^p}\right\rceil+b2^p.
\]

Its discrete first differences are nondecreasing. A recursive progress
sublevel, or a strict incumbent sublevel after adding certified fixed terms, is
therefore a contiguous integer interval. The engine can find its endpoints
with checked arithmetic without constructing matrices or recursive suffixes.

The complete schedule result uses an admissible relaxed suffix dynamic
program. The relaxation may admit extra transitions and may charge less than
the real planner, so its Bellman value is a lower bound on every realizable
suffix. A partial region may be removed only when its accumulated exact cost
plus that bound is strictly worse than a completed incumbent on the numeric
objective. Numeric equality is retained because the canonical descriptor can
still decide the winner.

The supporting proof file also defines transition dominance, interchangeable
group symmetry, and exact cache semantics. Selective L2 routes and setup first
slice choices remain independent search decisions until an equally complete
dominance certificate removes them. Local rank, slice, or next witness
improvements alone are not sufficient.

The core conservative rules are:

| Situation | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Certificate predicate is true | Remove only the region covered by the proved conclusion |
| Predicate is false or cannot be checked | Retain the region |
| Numeric lower bound equals the incumbent | Retain the region |
| Cache entry is absent or evicted | Recompute the exact state |
| Guide data is stale or invalid | Ignore that datum and continue the same search |
| Proof applies only to a local objective | Do not use it to prune a global frontier |


## Traversal and memory architecture

### Best first region traversal

The guided engine should order regions by an admissible complete objective
bound when one is available. An empirical estimate may break equal priority or
order regions which have no strong bound.

The engine should materialize the guided incumbent first. It should then prove
large regions irrelevant before enumerating individual candidates.

### Streaming group products

Group profile products, opening method products, and dimension products must be
generated incrementally. A batch is sent directly into the shared exact root
frontier. The full union is never stored.

The batch size is a performance setting. Changing it must not change the final
schedule. Tests must compare several batch sizes and reversed batch order.

### Parallelism

Independent regions may be evaluated in parallel. Workers return exact
candidates or certified exclusions. A deterministic reducer applies the shared
frontier and complete selector.

Wall clock race order must not decide an equal score. The canonical descriptor
is the final tie break.

### Resource limits

The planner may enforce explicit memory and work budgets in diagnostic tools.
A budget exhaustion result is distinct from `UnsupportedSchedule` and does not
authorize a partial optimum claim.

Production catalog generation must choose budgets which meet the supported
fixture contract. If those budgets are exhausted, generation fails with a
resource error and preserves diagnostics.

## Diagnostics and evidence

Every planner run should be able to report:

- normalized request and domain identities;
- guide identity and validation result;
- raw region and candidate counts;
- counts removed by each exact equivalence;
- counts removed by each pruning certificate;
- candidates fully materialized;
- typed rejection counts;
- suffix calls, memo hits, recomputations, and evictions;
- frontier sizes and peak retained candidates;
- time and peak memory by phase;
- selected complete objective and descriptor;
- runner up objective and gap;
- selected decisions at every level;
- ignored or stale guide entries;
- expansion and validation result.

An oracle run additionally emits a stable decision census. A guide generation
tool records which observations were used only for ordering and which facts
became checked certificates.

Diagnostics are not schedule identity unless a separate artifact format names
them. Timing, memory, and empirical estimates never enter proof or transcript
state.

Diagnostic reports and PR-attached performance records may show exact selected
rows for attribution. The repository must not retain those observations as
golden acceptance fixtures. The durable assertions are semantic: objective
order, descriptor determinism, oracle agreement, expansion, validation, and
declared performance envelopes.

## Output and runtime boundary

### Compact plan

The planner emits independent decisions and stable identities. It does not
emit unchecked mirrors of every derived field.

The compact plan contains:

- workload and domain identity;
- selected group commitment profiles;
- commitment epoch and closing group assignments;
- root decision;
- recursive decisions;
- setup prefix decisions;
- ring-relation transitions;
- terminal decision;
- objective policy identity;
- guide evidence identity for audit only.

`akita-schedules` expands the compact plan with canonical arithmetic and
security functions, validates the complete schedule, and computes the row
identity.

### Runtime catalog

The runtime consumer obtains an approved versioned catalog and resolves a row
from public workload geometry and profiles. Prover and verifier reconstruct the
same selection without running the planner.

Generated Rust tables remain the current runtime representation. A future
trusted-artifact migration is outside this planner overhaul and must not be a
prerequisite for it. If such a migration is adopted separately, artifact
trust, loading, and digest binding belong to `akita-schedules` and application
configuration; they do not give planner observations authority over protocol
semantics.

### Compatibility

Akita provides no backward compatibility guarantee. The workload request,
compact plan, guide artifact, and catalog identity may use new versioned
formats. The cutover must not retain old and new planner request types through
pass through wrappers.

Existing runtime schedule formats may migrate separately when a direct cut is
safer. During that migration, one canonical adapter may compile the new plan
to the existing exact runtime key. The adapter must contain no search or policy
logic.

## Performance contract

### Supported normal path

The guided execution is the only supported path for routine full catalog
generation. The oracle is a diagnostic and evidence path.

The first implementation must include at least these named fixtures:

1. A standard single group direct row.
2. A high pressure recursive row with at least 36 source variables.
3. An adaptive or setup offload row which requires a split frontier.
4. The Aerie Falcon version 1 eight group target workload.
5. The Aerie minimum batch workload where several groups use the commitment
   floor.

### Initial budgets

The first implementation records a post-#445 baseline before changing the
candidate language. On the same machine, toolchain, feature set, and bounded
thread count, each slice must report whether guided row time, full-catalog
time, and peak resident memory improved or regressed. A semantic-completeness
slice may temporarily regress, but it must identify the newly admitted domain
and recover the supported normal-path budget before the final cutover.

After the repository selects a reference runner and guide format, the target
budgets are:

- each named guided row **MUST** complete in at most 60 seconds;
- the full stock catalog **MUST** complete in at most 10 minutes;
- peak resident memory **MUST** remain at or below 4 GiB;
- each high pressure guided fixture **SHOULD** use at most 20 percent of the
  median oracle wall time when the oracle completes within the audit window.

The benchmark record must name the exact CPU, memory, operating system, Rust
version, feature set, thread count, and commit. Until the repository selects a
shared reference runner, no wall-clock number is a cross-machine merge gate.
Pull requests report paired before-and-after measurements, exact semantic
counters, and peak memory; correctness gates do not weaken when the host is
under load.

Three fresh process runs are required. The median wall time and maximum peak
memory are reported. Compilation and dependency download are excluded.

An implementation revision may change these budgets only through a reviewed
spec update with current measurements. It may not relax a budget by narrowing
the decision domain.

### Measurement commands

The implementation must add a planner performance harness which accepts:

```text
--fixture <name>
--execution oracle|guided
--guide <path>
--json <path>
```

The JSON report contains the metrics listed under Diagnostics and Evidence.
The harness runs the same public planning entry point used by catalog
generation.

Full catalog validation continues to use:

```bash
scripts/generate-schedule-tables.sh --row-progress
```

The implementation may add a wrapper for repeat runs and peak memory capture.
It must not maintain a second fixture planner.

### Testing strategy

Small exhaustive grid tests must compare every guided result with the oracle.
The grid must vary split, basis, dimensions, slice count, opening method,
security route, setup offload choice, terminal choice, and group profile choice
where each coordinate is supported.

The L2 grid must include cases where the best Linf and L2 routes use different
splits. It must include every L2 table boundary and a missing or stale modeled
cap. The setup first grid must include every slice count and cases where local
setup order disagrees with complete schedule order.

Property tests must randomize enumeration order, reverse candidate order, vary
streaming batch size, and vary memo capacity. Every run must return the same
complete objective and descriptor.

Relation tests must vary every legal monotone cutover independently of payload
phase, Linf or L2 route, dimensions, and setup-prefix disappearance. They must
retain the small `m + 1` cutover oracle even after the shared engine has an
oracle execution mode.

Each pruning certificate must have a focused proof test and an integration
test which disables only that rule. Boundary tests must cover equality with the
incumbent because equal numeric bounds cannot prune the descriptor tie break.

Overflow tests must force every checked bound to return unknown. The candidate
must remain in the search and later materialization must return the canonical
typed arithmetic error if the exact candidate itself overflows.

Group workload tests must cover:

- one epoch and one group;
- one epoch with several groups;
- two epochs separated by a challenge;
- heterogeneous source contracts;
- a closing group narrower than a frozen group;
- exchangeable groups with a valid symmetry quotient;
- ordered groups which must not be quotiented;
- the two Aerie fixtures named in the performance contract.

Catalog tests must distinguish:

- same revision drift;
- intentional selection changes;
- workload key changes;
- guide changes which preserve the selected schedule;
- guide changes which expose a stale certificate;
- compact plan expansion changes;
- row identity changes.

They must not snapshot exact selected rows, cutover levels, witness lengths, or
proof-byte totals merely to preserve the current planner output. Intentional
selection changes are reviewed through regenerated tables, semantic replay,
and PR-attached attribution.

The standard repository checks remain required. Planner implementation pull
requests must also run all Clippy feature graphs listed in `AGENTS.md` and the
full schedule drift job command from `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Execution plan

### Slice 1: Complete setup-first slice domain

Remove `prune_locally_unprofitable_slices` from root, recursive Linf, and
recursive selective-L2 candidate generation. Materialize every feasible member
of the four-value slice domain and retain it through exact successor sizing and
the existing complete suffix frontiers. Do not replace the shortcut with a new
local score or wrapper authority.

Focused tests must show that one feasible root split and one feasible recursive
split each retain all four slice transitions under the setup-first V2 policy.
The independent small oracle must continue to agree on the complete objective
and descriptor. Regenerate and replay every affected generated schedule; a
selected-row change is an expected planner result, not a compatibility failure.

This slice deliberately adds no slice-dominance theorem. Slice 6 may recover
performance after it can prove that an omitted slice is irrelevant to every
parent and suffix consumer. Diagnostic counters should be added with the
semantic slice they measure rather than through a separate instrumentation-only
implementation layer.

### Slice 2: Canonical decisions and typed rejection

Introduce small decision types for root, recursive, terminal, security route,
and group commitment choices. Reuse the existing typed `RelationTransition`
and `RingRelationPhase`; do not wrap or duplicate them. Extract canonical
materialization and typed rejections without changing selected schedules.
Make the complete enumerated domain inspectable before materialization.

### Slice 3: Shared oracle

Make every enumerator expose its complete audited domain. Convert the current
test-only unpruned recursive enumeration into an oracle execution setting of
the shared engine, while keeping the small monotone relation-cutover oracle
independent. Establish exact small-grid agreement on the full V2 objective and
descriptor. Oracle mode disables optional pruning; it does not fork
materialization or selection.

### Slice 4: Exact split cells and local bounds

Implement the exact mandatory body identity, split cell builder, discrete
convex interval, and incumbent interval. Keep the cheap scan over every integer
split. Remove `BoundedBalancedExtremesV1` as an exact production domain while
preserving its balance estimate as traversal order. Relation mode, payload
phase, security route, and every rank or digit boundary participate in the
cell signature. Compare exhaustive and guided objectives and descriptors; do
not snapshot the resulting schedule rows.

### Slice 5: Selective L2 route frontier

Remove the production dependency on the best modeled Linf split. Enumerate L2
at every surviving split cell and relation mode, build the full route
transition signature, and retain both routes unless
`l2_route_dominance_v1` proves complete-objective irrelevance. Reuse the
post-#445 independent L2 enumerator as comparison evidence until shared oracle
execution supersedes it.

### Slice 6: Certified slice dominance

Add one canonical slice transition frontier only if retaining all four slices
is a material performance cost. Apply `setup_slice_dominance_v1` only when the
shared dominance theorem covers every parent observation and suffix consumer.
Test the optimized frontier against the complete Slice 1 domain under both V2
objectives, including root output-witness and descriptor ties.

### Slice 7: Relaxed suffix bounds and transition dominance

Add `relaxed_suffix_dp_v1` with exact current edge bytes and a proved minimum
terminal cost. Extend it one monotone term at a time. Add the shared transition
dominance checker and replace level-based frontier retention only where its
complete consumer proof is checked. An equal bound through root output witness
must retain the candidate for descriptor comparison.

### Slice 8: Guide artifacts

Add guide generation, validation, incumbent seeding, ordering hints, and
certificate replay. A guide is disposable acceleration data: tests prove that
deleting it changes only work, and no checked-in exact incumbent becomes a
compatibility fixture. Produce review evidence for named recursive fixtures;
check in a guide only if routine generation cannot meet its supported budget
without it.

### Slice 9: Workload and group profile planning

Introduce `CommitmentWorkload` information, ordered epochs, and an explicit
batch opening policy. Integrate exact group profile candidates, symmetry, and
streamed root frontiers.

### Slice 10: Aerie integration

Express the Aerie eight group workloads through epochs and a closing group.
Bind the selected plan before the first commitment. Compile `S1`, `Epsilon`,
`S2SourcesFour`, `BudgetTwo`, `BudgetOne`, `JlTwo`, and `JlOne` to frozen
profiles, with `JlFour` as the final group. Remove application code which
constructs those seven precommits plus the final JL group as the planner
facing model.

### Slice 11: Runtime and catalog cutover

Emit one compact plan, validate it through `akita-schedules`, regenerate stock
catalogs, and remove superseded planner request and wrapper paths. Keep any
trusted catalog artifact migration separate from search semantics. Generated
Rust tables remain acceptable; this slice does not introduce an artifact
catalog or golden planner-output report.

### Slice 12: Performance gate and documentation

Land the performance harness, named fixture records, guide evidence, and CI or
scheduled audit jobs. Update the Book configuration chapter and archive this
spec after the durable architecture is implemented and taught there. Store
semantic counters and environment-pinned performance evidence, not exact
generated schedule choices.

## Intended code ownership

The implementation should converge on ownership close to this map.

| Responsibility | Intended owner |
|---|---|
| Workload and domain normalization | `akita-planner` request module |
| Root decisions | root candidate module |
| Recursive decisions | recursive candidate module |
| Terminal decisions | terminal candidate module |
| Group commitment profile decisions | group profile candidate module |
| Exact materialization | focused schedule parameter modules |
| Split cells and certified bounds | planner bound module |
| Security route frontier | recursive security route candidate module |
| Slice transition frontier | recursive slice candidate module |
| Relaxed suffix value | suffix bound module |
| Complete objectives | objective module |
| Parent observable frontier | suffix frontier module |
| Search queue and guide replay | search module |
| Diagnostics and census | diagnostics module |
| Compact plan emission | emitter module |
| Expansion and validation | `akita-schedules` |
| Runtime catalog resolution | `akita-schedules` and `akita-config` |

The current files may move incrementally. The final architecture should not
leave `planner.rs`, `recursive.rs`, `suffix_dp.rs`, or the emitter as a general
owner for unrelated decisions merely to avoid adding a focused module.

## Alternatives considered

### Fixed split window

A fixed radius around the analytic balance point is fast, but it gives no
complete schedule optimality result. It remains useful as candidate ordering
inside the guided engine. It is not an exact production domain.

### Exhaustive production search

Full enumeration is a clear oracle but is too slow for routine catalog work.
The production path instead visits a strong incumbent first and certifies the
remaining regions.

### Guided attempt followed by exhaustive fallback

Two passes duplicate traversal and obscure the failure contract. One engine
with a persistent queue handles valid, stale, or absent guidance without a
restart.

### Trust the stored winning schedule

A stored schedule proves feasibility but not optimality under a changed
domain, objective, or security table. The guide must be versioned, and every
exclusion must be rechecked.

### Local best candidate at every level

Local minimization loses schedules whose next witness or parent visible
geometry improves the suffix. It is allowed only when a dominance theorem
covers every consumer.

### Use the Linf split for selective L2

The two routes can cross at different splits because their security ranks and
proof costs are different functions. Sharing bounds which do not depend on the
route is safe. Using the winner from one route as the domain of the other is not
safe without a complete route dominance certificate.

### Keep one setup first slice by local setup

The four value slice domain is cheap to inspect. Removing three values before
successor sizing gives little proven benefit and can hide a better complete
schedule. The target planner keeps their transition frontier and uses the
shared dominance theorem.

### Full Cartesian group product

Materializing every group profile combination consumes too much time and
memory. Streaming, symmetry, and complete lower bounds preserve exactness with
bounded working storage.

### Main group and precommitted groups

This vocabulary confuses semantic importance with commitment order. The
compiled grouped root still has one new group and frozen prior groups, but the
planner request describes semantic groups, epochs, source contracts, and a
closing role separately.

### Arbitrary commitment dependency graph

No current integration needs the extra complexity. Ordered epochs express the
Fiat-Shamir transcript and Aerie JL dependency directly.

### Add more public heuristic modes

Extra mode enums make heuristic choices part of catalog identity without
proving better semantics. Empirical models belong in versioned guide ordering.
Only audited domain and objective changes become public policy.

## Risks

### Complete bounds may be too weak

A mathematically valid lower bound can still leave most of the domain. The
guide must combine strong incumbents, region bounds, symmetry, and streaming.
Performance acceptance is separate from correctness acceptance.

### A frontier may omit a hidden parent observation

This is the main exactness risk. Every frontier proof must begin from the code
which prices a child in its parent. Tests must compare against the oracle under
all parent forms, including setup offload and grouped roots.

### Relation phase may be omitted from a state or bound

The same witness length and basis can have different legal successors in the
quotient prefix and reduced-evaluation suffix. Memo, relaxed-state, split-cell,
and transition signatures must preserve the typed phase or prove it
irrelevant. The canonical #445 transition token is the source of truth; a
Boolean `reduced` flag or mode-only cache key is insufficient.

### The objective may regress to its pre-V2 order

The root output-witness length is deliberately after the policy-specific setup
and proof coordinates and before the descriptor. Frontiers and bounds that
compare only proof, setup, and descriptor can select a different row on an
exact numeric tie. Focused tests must force this tie under both V2 policies.

### A split cell signature may miss a boundary

A missing rank, digit, relation, compression, source, or route field can apply
one formula outside its proved domain. The signature must be built from the
canonical materialization inputs. Boundary tests must compare every adjacent
split, not only the selected candidates.

### A relaxed suffix may be safe but ineffective

Merging too many states or charging zero for most future work preserves the
lower bound but leaves a large search. Diagnostics must report the incumbent
gap and candidates removed by each term. Performance work should strengthen
the weakest term without changing the real candidate domain.

### Guidance can become a second policy language

A guide which carries unchecked exclusions can silently replace the audited
domain. The guide format therefore names only checked certificate kinds. Any
other content is ordering data.

### Joint group planning can recreate a Cartesian explosion

Exact local profile frontiers, symmetry, and streamed combination are required
before broad workload support. The Aerie fixture is the acceptance test for
this risk.

### Closing group terminology may hide a real algebraic asymmetry

The new group does have distinct root commitment work. The design does not
pretend that all groups are internally identical. It names the asymmetry by its
actual role and prevents that role from owning unrelated semantic policy.

### Performance budgets can become machine noise

Every measurement records the exact environment and uses repeated fresh
process runs. Before a shared reference runner is selected, paired semantic
counters and same-host measurements are review evidence rather than a
cross-machine wall-clock gate.

### Caches may become hidden semantic authorities

The complete-source compression cache, response-model caches, setup-prefix
cache, and suffix memo all predate this target architecture. Cache identity,
capacity, and eviction must affect work only. Zero-reuse and eviction tests
must preserve the complete objective and descriptor, and cache contents must
not be serialized as proof, catalog, or guide authority.

### A guide may overfit checked catalog rows

An exact-row guide can accelerate regeneration, but the stored incumbent must
not become a golden schedule fixture. Broader guides must declare a region
predicate and pass oracle audits on interior and boundary samples before they
may prune that region. In both cases, deleting the guide preserves semantics.

## Documentation

While this specification is proposed or active, it remains the normative
planner architecture record. Existing implemented specs continue to own setup
offloading and group source security details.

When implementation is complete:

1. Fold the stable planner model into `book/src/how/configuration.md`.
2. Update `book/src/how/architecture.md` with the workload, planner, schedules,
   and runtime ownership boundary.
3. Update the Aerie integration documentation to use commitment epochs and
   closing group terminology.
4. Mark this spec implemented, set its implementation PRs, and check every
   completed acceptance item.
5. Archive it only after the Book owns the durable content.
