The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**,
**SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **NOT RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and
**OPTIONAL** in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

## Summary

Akita supports opening batches whose commitment groups use different concrete
polynomial representations. The protocol does not need to name those
representations. It needs the exact public geometry and the exact schedule row
that the verifier checks.

This specification defines two boundaries.

First, runtime protocol state is source-free. A committed group carries its
exact commitment profile. A selected schedule row carries the exact fold,
matrix, recursive, terminal, and wire parameters. Runtime code MUST NOT carry a
dense, one-hot, lookup, or application source tag.

Second, each group owns an offline honest fold sizing policy. That policy uses
the group distribution and the candidate fold geometry to select
`num_digits_fold`. The core planner checks the selected digit depth and prices
its exact protocol consequences. The planner MUST NOT reinterpret or reduce a
policy result.

The balanced signed digit policy uses the universal signed-sparse tail bound.
The unit one-hot policy uses the exact physical source classes and a
one-coordinate moment generating function. It falls back to the deterministic
convolution envelope when the exact calculation is unavailable. Neither policy
applies an empirical digit-boundary discount.

Intermediate folds and terminal raw responses have different contracts.
Intermediate folds are accepted through balanced digit decomposition, so their
schedule rows store `num_digits_fold` and do not store a separate honest
infinity norm cap. Terminal responses are raw integers. Their verifier-visible
shape stores the selected norm route, an optional Linf cap, and the exact
Golomb-Rice wire parameters. A terminal L2 route stores no Linf cap.

## Intent

### Goals

This cut MUST do the following:

1. Keep commitments, public profiles, setup, schedule lookup, transcripts,
   proofs, and verification free of source identity.
2. Replace planner-facing `FoldWitnessNorms` with a group-owned offline fold
   sizing policy.
3. Make `num_digits_fold` the only honest sizing output for an intermediate
   digitized fold.
4. Replace field-specific digit-boundary discounts with the universal
   signed-sparse tail result.
5. Add an exact unit one-hot sizing policy with the universal result as its
   fallback and dominance guard.
6. Move terminal norm admission and Golomb-Rice ownership into the terminal
   response shape.
7. Remove all residual ZK grind probe behavior. Akita has one sequential probe
   rule.
8. Complete the cutover without compatibility wrappers, deprecated aliases, or
   parallel legacy paths.

### Non-goals

This cut does not make an average-case source assumption for arbitrary dense
root witnesses.

This cut does not introduce per-group acceptance targets or allocate a miss
budget across groups. All policies use the same fixed protocol sizing
convention.

To preserve current behavior, that convention uses the existing global
`p_grind = 1/8` value. This value is a coarse generator cutoff. It is not a
per-group knob, a runtime field, or a verifier claim about observed acceptance.
The policy architecture does not claim a joint acceptance probability for all
groups that share one nonce.

This cut does not change the challenge sampler, the shared fold nonce, or the
nonce attempt limit.

This cut can change balanced signed digit proof size by removing the historical
digit-boundary discounts. Terminal norm admission and Golomb-Rice budgets
remain verifier-enforced schedule data.

## Ownership

### Runtime protocol state

The verifier MUST know:

- the exact commitment profile for every group;
- the ordered selected schedule row;
- each intermediate `log_basis` and `num_digits_fold`;
- the exact matrices and their security parameters;
- each challenge configuration;
- the shared nonce range and transcript position;
- each terminal norm route and optional Linf cap;
- each terminal Golomb-Rice remainder width and payload byte budget.

The verifier MUST NOT know:

- a source family name;
- a provider registration;
- dense coefficient bits;
- a one-hot chunk size;
- honest witness norms;
- an analytic tail cap;
- an empirical digit-depth calibration input;
- a planner cost model;
- a target acceptance probability;
- a prover probe order choice.

Two source implementations that produce valid witnesses for the same exact
profile and schedule row are protocol equivalent.

### Offline group policy

Each group configuration MUST select its own honest fold sizing policy before
the core planner evaluates a candidate row. The policy MAY use facts about the
honest source that do not appear in runtime state.

The policy result is authoritative. The core planner MUST NOT apply another
discount or source-specific correction to it.

The core planner MUST still reject a result that fails a hard protocol check,
including arithmetic capacity, matrix capacity, dimension validity, or SIS
security.

### Source decomposition basis

The A commitment basis and the response or opening basis are independent
planner coordinates. `inner_basis_range` is the catalog-bound search policy for
the A source. `opening_basis_range` is the catalog-bound search policy for the
fold response and the B, D, and opening commitments. A generated catalog MUST
bind both complete ranges, including candidates that do not win a row.

The offline planner classifies the A source as exactly one of these cases:

- `RawCoefficients { log_bound }` searches the configured inner range, capped
  by the source bound. Its digit depth is derived from that bound and the
  selected inner basis.
- `UnitOneHot` uses one exact digit at the minimum configured inner basis. It
  MUST NOT be priced as a dense field element.
- `BalancedDigits { log_basis }` is an already decomposed recursive witness. It
  uses one digit at the basis that produced it.

An already balanced recursive witness MUST NOT be decomposed again at another
basis. Re-decomposition would change the source representation whose norm was
used to select the preceding fold depth. Each recursive level therefore carries
the predecessor response basis into its A source. This source classification is
offline policy only. Runtime profiles carry the resulting exact basis, digit
depth, widths, ranks, and bounds without a source tag.

Proof-optimized catalogs currently admit inner bases 3 through 10 for the Q32
modulus profile and 3 through 16 for Q64 and Q128. These upper limits are
versioned search-policy choices, not protocol or signed-storage limits. Bases 9
through 16 require the exact signed-i16 commitment path. Widening a catalog
range requires a new sweep, SIS coverage for every admitted A cell, catalog
regeneration, and a changed catalog identity. It does not require a wire-format
change.

The source norm MUST be computed from the selected inner basis and A ring
dimension. Balanced sources use
`FoldWitnessNorms::bounded(log_basis_inner, d_a)`; unit one-hot sources use the
sparse norm owned by their offline policy, including its exact source chunk
size. The chunk size MUST NOT be copied into runtime group geometry. The honest
fold policy derives `num_digits_fold`
from that source norm and the selected response basis. The A-role SIS collision
bound is then computed from the A ring dimension, response basis, selected fold
digit depth, and challenge distribution. Planner pricing and runtime admission
MUST use those same values. Decoupling the response basis therefore does not
weaken the A bound: the source norm fixes the required response depth, and that
exact response plan fixes the certified A-role bound.

### Generated schedule rows

A generated intermediate row MUST store the selected `num_digits_fold`.

A generated intermediate row MUST NOT store `fold_witness_linf_cap` or another
field with the same meaning.

The row MUST freeze every downstream consequence of `num_digits_fold`,
including matrix widths, ranks, setup use, proof shape, and the row digest.

The generator MAY report the analytic cap and final digit depth for audit.
These diagnostics MUST NOT enter runtime types or protocol identity.

## Honest fold sizing contract

### Minimal interface

The intended interface is:

```rust
pub struct HonestFoldSizingQuery<'a> {
    pub ring_dimension: usize,
    pub num_claims: usize,
    pub num_live_blocks: usize,
    pub num_chunks: usize,
    pub num_fold_coeffs: usize,
    pub log_basis: u32,
    pub challenge_config: &'a SparseChallengeConfig,
}

pub trait HonestFoldPolicy {
    fn num_digits_fold(
        &self,
        query: HonestFoldSizingQuery<'_>,
    ) -> Result<usize, AkitaError>;
}
```

The final names MAY change. The ownership and information content are
normative.

The trait returns a scalar because an intermediate fold has one honest sizing
decision. An `HonestFoldPlan` wrapper with only `num_digits_fold` SHOULD NOT be
introduced.

The trait itself SHOULD NOT require `Sync`. A caller that evaluates policies in
parallel MAY require `HonestFoldPolicy + Sync` at that call site.

### Query fields

`ring_dimension` is REQUIRED because the challenge occupancy law depends on the
ring dimension.

`num_claims` and `num_live_blocks` are REQUIRED because they determine the
number and structure of fold contributions.

`num_chunks` is REQUIRED because the prover emits and the verifier admits one
physical response window per chunk. It MUST be positive and no greater than
`num_live_blocks`.

`num_fold_coeffs` is REQUIRED because the policy sizes the maximum over every
actual emitted coefficient in every chunk response. The caller MUST pass the
total physical coefficient count, not a single logical window or a padded
allocation width. The count MUST divide evenly by `num_chunks` because every
chunk response has the same physical width.

The balanced signed digit policy reconstructs one logical response-window
coefficient count by dividing `num_fold_coeffs` by `num_chunks`. The unit
one-hot MGF uses the complete emitted coefficient count because it bounds the
maximum across every chunk response.

`log_basis` is REQUIRED because the policy selects a balanced digit depth.

`challenge_config` is REQUIRED because it defines the challenge law.

`field_bits` MUST NOT appear in this query. A field-specific policy carries it
when the group configuration constructs the policy. Hard field capacity
remains a core planner check.

`inner_width` MUST NOT appear under that ambiguous name. If the implementation
can derive `num_fold_coeffs` from checked geometry without losing information,
it MAY remove `num_fold_coeffs` from the query and use that one canonical
derivation. It MUST NOT carry both independent values without validating their
equality.

### Policy result

The policy MUST return the final `num_digits_fold` selected by its analytic
model and universal completeness guard.

The policy MUST NOT return an analytic infinity norm cap for an intermediate
fold. That cap is an internal planning value. Once the policy has selected the
digit depth, the cap has no independent protocol meaning.

The planner MUST compute the accepted negative and positive coefficient bounds
from `log_basis` and `num_digits_fold` through the canonical balanced digit
functions.

## Universal completeness guard

The balanced signed digit policy sizes directly from the smaller of the
deterministic ring-product envelope and the signed-sparse tail threshold. It
does not multiply that threshold by an empirical constant before rounding to a
digit depth.

The unit one-hot policy computes an MGF threshold from kernel-faithful physical
source classes and compares it with the deterministic convolution envelope.
The smaller valid cap determines the digit depth. The deterministic envelope
is the fallback when the exact MGF calculation is unavailable.

## Exact unit one-hot model

### Applicability

The exact unit one-hot model applies when every logical
witness block has at most one nonzero coefficient and that coefficient has
absolute value one.

The group configuration establishes this fact offline when it selects the
policy. Runtime profiles and the verifier MUST NOT carry or validate a one-hot
tag.

If the group configuration cannot establish the unit one-hot condition, it
MUST use the balanced signed digit policy or another valid group-owned policy.

### One-coordinate moment generating function

Let a challenge of ring dimension `D` contain `k_a` coefficients of magnitude
`a`, with independent symmetric signs and uniformly sampled support without
replacement. For a fixed unit one-hot witness location, one contribution `X`
has moment generating function

\[
M_X(\lambda)
=
1+
\sum_{a\ge 1}
\frac{k_a}{D}\left(\cosh(a\lambda)-1\right).
\]

For the shipping `D = 64` challenge with 31 coefficients of magnitude one and
11 coefficients of magnitude two, the policy MUST use

\[
M_X(\lambda)
=
1+
\frac{31}{64}(\cosh\lambda-1)
+
\frac{11}{64}(\cosh2\lambda-1).
\]

The constants 31 and 11 are specific to `D = 64`. Other ring dimensions MUST
derive their counts from the selected `SparseChallengeConfig`. They MUST NOT
reuse the `D = 64` constants.

One physical planner block can pack more than one canonical one-hot source
chunk. Let

\[
p =
\frac{\mathtt{num\_fold\_coeffs}}
     {\mathtt{num\_chunks}\,D}
\]

be its logical source-position width and let `s` be the configured one-hot
source chunk size. The number of unit one-hot entries packed into one live
block is

\[
u=\left\lceil\frac{p}{s}\right\rceil.
\]

At most

\[
m = \mathtt{num\_claims}\left\lceil
\frac{\mathtt{num\_live\_blocks}}{\mathtt{num\_chunks}}
\right\rceil u
\]

independent unit contributions enter one coordinate of a physical chunk
response. The first ceiling prices the largest response window when blocks do
not divide evenly across chunks. The factor `u` is required because every
packed one-hot entry contributes separately. Omitting it understates both the
Chernoff threshold and the deterministic worst-case cap whenever `p > s`.
Then

\[
M_Z(\lambda)=M_X(\lambda)^m.
\]

For `N = num_fold_coeffs`, where `N` counts coefficients across every physical
chunk response, the policy computes the smallest integer threshold `t` for
which the fixed protocol cutoff is met:

\[
2N\inf_{\lambda>0}
\exp(-\lambda t)M_X(\lambda)^m
\le 1-p_{\mathrm{grind}}=\frac{7}{8}.
\]

The protocol uses one fixed convention for all groups. The query MUST NOT carry
a per-group target probability or miss allocation.

The numeric procedure MUST be deterministic for schedule generation. It MUST
not understate its computed upper bound because of floating point rounding.

### Dominance guard

The unit one-hot cutover is allowed to tighten sizing. It is not allowed to
increase proof size.

For every candidate row, the generator MUST also compute the universal balanced
signed digit result. The selected unit one-hot digit depth MUST be no greater
than that result.

The policy MUST also clamp any analytic threshold by the deterministic
worst-case ring product bound before converting it to a digit depth.

If the exact model is unavailable for a ring dimension or challenge
configuration, the policy MUST use the universal result.

## Intermediate fold admission

For an intermediate fold, the accepted coefficient interval is exactly the
interval represented by `log_basis` and `num_digits_fold`.

The prover MUST accept a candidate nonce only if every centered fold
coefficient fits that interval and all other existing fold checks pass.

The prover MUST NOT apply a second check against an analytic
`fold_witness_linf_cap`.

The verifier MUST continue to enforce the balanced digit decomposition and
range relations. It MUST NOT evaluate the honest fold policy.

The shared fold-response nonce remains a 12-bit value. The prover MUST probe
nonces in ascending order starting at zero and MUST publish the first
accepting nonce in the proof-level packed stream. The verifier MUST reject a
decoded value outside the fixed global attempt range.

Akita MUST remove transcript-seeded shuffle constants, descriptor fields,
preview labels, permutation helpers, branches, and tests that exist only for ZK
probe order. There is no ZK-specific fold grind behavior in this protocol.

## Terminal response and Golomb-Rice contract

### Why the terminal is separate

A terminal response carries raw centered integers. No later balanced digit
decomposition constrains those integers. The verifier therefore checks the norm
selected by the terminal A route directly.

For a Linf route, the raw coefficient cap is verifier admission data and MUST
fit the terminal matrix security capacity. For an L2 route, no independent
Linf cap exists. The signed coefficient type and Golomb-Rice byte budget are
wire constraints, and the complete scheduled L2 cap is the norm admission.

### Exact terminal shape

Each terminal response group shape MUST own these exact values:

```rust
pub struct TerminalResponseGroupShape {
    pub z_coords: usize,
    pub e_field_elems: usize,
    pub t_field_elems: usize,
    pub z_linf_cap: Option<u128>,
    pub z_rice_low_bits: u32,
    pub z_payload_bytes: usize,
}
```

The final name MAY remain `TailSegmentGroupLayout`. The field ownership is
normative.

`z_linf_cap` is present only for a terminal Linf route. In that route it is the
maximum raw absolute coefficient accepted by the verifier. A terminal L2 route
MUST set it to `None`. Its decoded `z` is checked only against the complete
scheduled L2 bound.

`z_rice_low_bits` is the actual Golomb-Rice remainder width used by both the
encoder and decoder. It MUST NOT be a planning proxy that runtime code converts
again.

`z_payload_bytes` is the maximum encoded payload length accepted for that
group.

The canonical zigzag width MAY be derived from `z_linf_cap` for a Linf route.
For an L2 route it MUST cover the signed coefficient representation. It need
not be stored when one total derivation exists.

### Offline versus runtime use

An offline terminal planner MAY use an honest distribution estimate to select
the Rice remainder width and payload budget. It MUST emit the exact selected
wire values into the terminal response shape.

Runtime encoding and decoding MUST consume the terminal shape directly. They
MUST NOT call `fold_witness_linf_cap_for_claims`, rebuild a fold tail model, or
read intermediate `num_digits_fold` to recover terminal wire parameters.

For a Linf route, the prover MUST check that every raw terminal coefficient is
within `z_linf_cap`. For an L2 route, it MUST instead check the complete sum of
squared decoded coefficients against the scheduled L2 cap. In both routes it
MUST require the signed coefficient representation, encode with
`z_rice_low_bits`, and reject a candidate whose encoded payload exceeds
`z_payload_bytes`.

The verifier MUST decode with the same `z_rice_low_bits`, reject values outside
the signed coefficient representation, and reject a payload longer than
`z_payload_bytes`. It MUST enforce `z_linf_cap` only for a Linf route. For an L2
route it MUST enforce the complete scheduled L2 bound and MUST NOT impose an
independent Linf cap.

The terminal response shape and all these fields MUST be bound into the exact
schedule row and transcript descriptor.

### Behavior preservation

For every existing terminal Linf schedule, this cut MUST preserve:

- the raw terminal coefficient cap;
- the actual Golomb-Rice remainder width;
- the terminal payload byte budget;
- the serialized proof size produced by the same fixture.

The implementation MAY rename fields and move their owner. It MUST NOT change
these values as an incidental effect of the ownership cutover.

One-hot rows MAY produce smaller intermediate digit depths through the exact
MGF policy. Any resulting terminal wire change MUST be an intentional
consequence of that tighter one-hot result and MUST be reported by the profile
benchmark.

## Protocol identity

Protocol identity MUST bind exact accepted and wire parameters. It MUST NOT bind
offline model inputs that have no runtime meaning.

The descriptor MUST bind:

- the fixed global nonce limit and nonce wire width;
- the fact that probe order is sequential;
- each intermediate digit depth and basis through the selected row;
- each terminal norm route and optional Linf cap;
- each terminal Rice remainder width;
- each terminal payload byte budget.

The descriptor MUST NOT bind:

- balanced witness norms;
- unit one-hot tags;
- exact MGF coefficients as a separate runtime policy identity;
- empirical digit-depth calibration constants;
- analytic caps;
- a terminal average-case planner model identifier;
- a cap-to-Rice conversion rule or delta;
- ZK probe order.

Changing an offline policy requires regenerated rows. If the exact generated
row changes, its digest changes through those exact consequences.

## Required cutover

The implementation MUST complete these changes in one pass:

1. Introduce the minimal group-owned `HonestFoldPolicy` boundary.
2. Put the universal balanced signed digit formula behind that policy.
3. Add the exact unit one-hot policy with the universal dominance guard.
4. Make planner candidate construction consume only the returned
   `num_digits_fold`.
5. Remove planner-facing `FoldWitnessNorms` and all source model fields from
   core planner keys and cache identities.
6. Remove intermediate `fold_witness_linf_cap` from generated rows, runtime
   group parameters, setup descriptors, schedule digests, and grind contracts.
7. Make intermediate grind acceptance use the canonical balanced digit interval
   only.
8. Add the terminal route's optional Linf cap to the terminal group shape and
   make exact Rice parameters authoritative there.
9. Rewire terminal builders, decoders, proof sizing, schedule validation, and
   verifier admission to consume the terminal shape.
10. Delete ZK probe shuffle code and descriptor fields. Delete terminal planner
    model and cap-to-Rice rule fields once the exact terminal shape replaces
    them.
11. Regenerate all affected schedule tables and pinned descriptors.
12. Delete obsolete helpers, wrappers, aliases, tests, and documentation.

## Invariants

1. **Source-free runtime.** Runtime and verifier types contain no source or
   honest distribution identity.
2. **Policy ownership.** Each group policy selects its final digit depth. The
   core planner does not revise it.
3. **Exact intermediate admission.** Intermediate prover acceptance and
   verifier range checks use the same balanced digit interval.
4. **Accepted-range security.** Matrix pricing uses the full coefficient range
   admitted by the verifier.
5. **Exact terminal contract.** Terminal encoder, decoder, proof sizing, and
   verifier admission use one schedule-bound response shape.
6. **Balanced behavior preservation.** Existing balanced signed digit rows and
   proof fixtures do not drift.
7. **One-hot non-regression.** The exact unit one-hot policy never selects more
   digits than the universal result.
8. **One probe rule.** Every fold uses the same sequential shared nonce rule.
9. **Planner-free verification.** The verifier does not execute honest sizing
   policies or planner search.
10. **No verifier panic.** Malformed dimensions, caps, codec parameters,
    payloads, and nonces return `AkitaError` or `SerializationError`.
11. **Full cutover.** No legacy cap path or compatibility layer remains.

## Evaluation

### Required regression fixtures

Before replacing the old implementation, tests MUST record the existing
balanced signed digit outputs for every shipped family and relevant candidate
geometry.

After the cutover, tests MUST prove exact equality for:

- `num_digits_fold`;
- accepted negative and positive digit bounds;
- matrix widths and ranks affected by the fold depth;
- terminal norm routes and optional Linf caps;
- terminal Rice remainder widths;
- terminal payload byte budgets;
- serialized proof sizes for fixed balanced fixtures.

Descriptor bytes and row digests are expected to change because obsolete
fields are removed and terminal fields move. Tests MUST pin the new values.

### Unit one-hot tests

Tests MUST cover the following:

- the `D = 64` moment generating function uses counts 31 and 10;
- other ring dimensions derive their counts from their challenge config;
- the exact MGF agrees with direct enumeration of the one-coordinate law;
- the optimized tail expression is no larger than the deterministic bound;
- every selected one-hot digit depth is no greater than the universal result;
- at least one row tightens when the exact model supports a smaller depth;
- unsupported source conditions use the universal fallback.

### Intermediate admission tests

Tests MUST prove that:

- every coefficient inside the balanced digit interval is accepted by the
  intermediate admission predicate;
- either endpoint outside that interval is rejected;
- no intermediate analytic cap check remains;
- the prover and verifier replay the same sequential nonce;
- the attempt limit rejects an out-of-range nonce;
- no transcript shuffle symbol or branch remains.

### Terminal wire tests

Tests MUST prove that:

- encoding and decoding use the exact `z_rice_low_bits` from the terminal shape;
- Linf routes reject coefficients above `z_linf_cap`;
- L2 routes carry no independent Linf cap and reject a decoded response whose
  complete squared norm exceeds the scheduled L2 cap;
- both routes reject coefficients outside the signed wire representation;
- payloads above `z_payload_bytes` are rejected before an unbounded allocation;
- a terminal Linf cap does not exceed matrix security capacity;
- runtime terminal code does not call an honest fold sizing policy;
- fixed balanced fixtures preserve their old cap, Rice width, byte budget, and
  proof size.

### Schedule and end-to-end tests

The generated schedule drift guards MUST pass after regeneration.

Dense, one-hot, extension field, mixed group, recursive, terminal, and
setup prefix end-to-end tests MUST pass.

The profile benchmark report MUST compare the new rows with the merge base for
each affected mode and explain any proof-size movement caused by removing the
historical discounts.

All repository documentation guardrails and CI commands in `AGENTS.md` MUST
pass.

## Alternatives rejected

### Return both cap and digit depth

An intermediate analytic cap has no independent protocol use after the policy
selects the digit depth. Returning both values creates two facts that can drift.
The policy returns the digit depth only.

### Let the planner discount every policy result

This makes the planner silently distrust group-owned results and hides an
empirical calibration in a global planner operation. Policies instead return
their complete analytic result.

### Store the intermediate cap for Golomb-Rice

This gives one field two unrelated owners. Intermediate admission uses balanced
digits. Terminal coding uses raw response and wire parameters. The terminal
shape stores the latter directly.

### Apply an empirical ratio to the exact one-hot estimate

The exact MGF already has a stated probability target. Multiplying it by an
unrelated ratio discards that interpretation and can silently under-size a
digit interval.

### Carry `field_bits` in every sizing query

The group configuration can construct the correct field-specific policy once.
The planner separately checks hard field capacity.

### Bind analytic policy inputs into protocol identity

The verifier accepts exact digit and terminal envelopes. It does not verify the
honest distribution model. Binding model inputs would enlarge runtime identity
without strengthening soundness.

## Documentation

The implementation MUST update:

- [`fold-linf-rejection.md`](fold-linf-rejection.md) to mark its old cap and ZK
  probe ownership as superseded;
- [`archive/2026-Q3/tail-wire-encoding.md`](archive/2026-Q3/tail-wire-encoding.md) to name the terminal response
  shape as the wire authority;
- [`book/src/how/architecture.md`](../book/src/how/architecture.md) to describe
  the offline group policy and source-free runtime boundary;
- [`book/src/how/verification.md`](../book/src/how/verification.md) to distinguish
  intermediate digit admission from terminal raw response admission.
