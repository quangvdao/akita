## Summary

Akita should support base fields beyond the current fp128 production field,
starting with 32-bit and 64-bit prime-field profiles. This PR implements the
scaffolding needed for that generalization while deliberately stopping before
the native extension-opening and batching cutover. It splits field roles,
threads extension-aware transcript helpers, adds ring-subfield field-reduction
reference utilities, makes planner/proof-size accounting field-width-aware, adds
static fp32/fp64 configs and E2E coverage, and preserves the existing fp128
verifier behavior.

The next PR owns native small-field commitments opened at extension-field
points, including the batching generalization and recursive extension-opening
reduction needed to keep the folded proof-size small.

As of PR #71, most items that were deferred from this scaffolding PR have
landed in follow-up commits: proof payloads are generic over `F, L`, root and
recursive extension openings use explicit ring-subfield field-reduction
boundaries, terminal recursive witnesses serialize as compact packed digits,
SIS sizing is keyed by `Q32`/`Q64`/`Q128` families with larger small-field D
candidates, and the small-field path now uses tensor-algebra
extension-opening reduction instead of the superseded Frobenius-conjugate
multipoint route. The root tensor-projection slice moved the transformed
witness to the root commitment boundary for supported same-width `E = L`
small-field roots, so those roots no longer rely on the huge root-direct
fallback. Generated production fp32/fp64 schedule tables are now family-bound
by SIS modulus, include extension-opening-reduction proof bytes in planned
accounting, price the small-field `psi` embedding norm bound in SIS A-role
collisions, and cover separate dense and one-hot configs for fp32
`D = 64,128,256,512` plus fp64 `D = 32,64,128,256` through `num_vars <= 32`
for singleton and same-point `np=4` shapes. fp32 `D=32` remains a tuning-only
candidate under the current rank-4 SIS floor table.

## Intent

### Goal

Prepare Akita's crate-decomposed protocol stack for general base fields by
introducing typed field roles, extension transcript plumbing, reference
field-reduction math, field-width-aware planning, and small-field integration
coverage, without changing the public base-field opening API in this PR.

### Scope Boundary

This PR does everything up to the point where extension-field openings require
a better public claim model. The current public prover/verifier inputs still
take base-field opening points and base-field claimed evaluations. That is
intentional. `ClaimField` and `ChallengeField` are introduced as typed staging
points so the follow-up can migrate existing surfaces in place.

This PR must not add parallel public APIs for each batching special case. The
follow-up spec defines the point/group/claim incidence model for the native
extension-opening cutover.

### Invariants

- Ring commitments, setup matrices, digit decomposition, CRT/NTT work, and SIS
  bounds remain over `Cfg::Field`.
- In the original scaffolding PR, SIS bounds were still served by the existing
  fp128-calibrated registry. The follow-up completion work moved generated SIS
  floors and schedule tables to explicit `Q32`/`Q64`/`Q128` families.
- Existing fp128 presets continue to use
  `Field = ClaimField = ChallengeField`.
- Extension absorption is coordinate-order sensitive and deterministic.
- Extension challenge sampling draws all base-field limbs and must not silently
  project challenges back into the base field.
- The current verifier shortcut remains the `k = 1` specialization of the
  subgroup trace relation and stays constant time in the hot path.
- Planner digit counts and proof-size estimates respect the configured field
  bit width instead of assuming 128-bit elements.
- The original static fp32/fp64 configs were scaffolding profiles. The follow-up
  completion work replaced the production surface with dense and one-hot
  generated small-field configs.
- Local scratch notes and generated planning scripts remain untracked and are
  not part of this PR.

### Non-Goals

- The original scaffolding PR did not complete extension-valued public opening
  claims in the production prover/verifier API. PR #71 now has the baseline
  extension path, incidence model, and tensor-algebra extension-opening
  reduction; remaining hardening is tracked in
  `specs/extension-field-opening-batching.md`.
- This spec no longer owns the `k > 1` ring-subfield embedding,
  recursive base/ext opening reduction, or public batched-claim incidence
  model. Those moved into the PR #71 completion spec.
- The original scaffolding PR did not regenerate production fp32/fp64 schedule
  tables or security-calibrate their SIS sizing. Those items moved into
  `specs/extension-field-opening-batching.md` and have now landed there.
- This does not replace every protocol challenge with `Cfg::ChallengeField`.
- This does not benchmark or tune extension-field arithmetic.
- This does not change the default fp128 production preset or its security
  parameters.

### Testing Strategy

Existing tests that must continue passing:

- `cargo fmt -q`
- `cargo clippy --all --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
- `cargo test`
- fp128 E2E tests in `crates/akita-pcs/tests/akita_e2e.rs`
- batched and multipoint E2E tests in `crates/akita-pcs/tests/`
- transcript tests in `crates/akita-pcs/tests/transcript.rs`

Targeted tests added or exercised by this PR:

- [x] `field_reduction` unit tests for subgroup validation, exponent
  cardinality, `trace_h`, `psi_pack`, and the `k = 1` shortcut relation.
- [x] Extension transcript replay tests for `Fp2` and `Fp4`.
- [x] Config helper tests proving `CommitmentConfig` helper output matches raw
  transcript helper output.
- [x] fp32 static dense E2E round trip.
- [x] fp64 static dense E2E round trip.
- [ ] Final CI run on the PR head after documentation-only updates.

### Performance

No runtime performance regression is expected for the default fp128 path. The
hot verifier relation remains the existing constant-term shortcut for `k = 1`;
the general `trace_h` implementation is a reference/test utility in this PR.

Planner and proof-size output changes are expected only where field byte widths
are explicitly different from fp128. Static fp32/fp64 profiles are integration
scaffolds, not tuned performance presets.

## Design

### Architecture

The PR touches five layers:

1. **Field layer**: `akita-field` owns the `ExtField` and `LiftBase` traits,
   plus fp32/fp64-wide arithmetic support needed by static small-field tests.
2. **Transcript layer**: `akita-transcript` owns coordinate-wise extension
   absorption and challenge sampling over a base-field transcript.
3. **Config layer**: `akita-config` owns role selection:
   `Field`, `ClaimField`, and `ChallengeField`.
4. **Types/layout layer**: `akita-types` owns reference field-reduction helpers
   and field-bit-width-aware digit math inputs.
5. **Planner/test layer**: `akita-planner`, `akita-config`, and `akita-pcs`
   exercise non-fp128 byte accounting and static fp32/fp64 E2E flows.

The field-role split is intentionally ahead of the public API. Today:

```text
commit/prove/verify public inputs:
  opening point, claimed eval  : Cfg::Field
  commitments, rings, setup    : Cfg::Field
```

After the follow-up cutover:

```text
commit/prove/verify public inputs:
  opening point, claimed eval  : Cfg::ClaimField
  commitments, rings, setup    : Cfg::Field
```

This PR stops before that second diagram becomes true.

### Field Roles

`CommitmentConfig` exposes:

- `type Field`: the base field used by rings, commitments, setup matrices,
  digit decomposition, and SIS bounds.
- `type ClaimField`: the intended field for public opening points and claimed
  evaluations.
- `type ChallengeField`: the intended field for Fiat-Shamir scalar challenges
  in sumcheck-style steps.

Config helper methods centralize transcript behavior:

```rust
fn append_claim_field<T: Transcript<Self::Field>>(
    transcript: &mut T,
    label: &[u8],
    x: &Self::ClaimField,
);

fn sample_challenge_field<T: Transcript<Self::Field>>(
    transcript: &mut T,
    label: &[u8],
) -> Self::ChallengeField;
```

### Extension Transcript Semantics

For `EXT_DEGREE = 1`, extension helpers preserve the existing transcript label
behavior. For `EXT_DEGREE > 1`, each base-field coordinate is absorbed or
sampled under a derived limb label:

```text
original label || 0xff || limb_index_le_u64 || "ext"
```

This makes coordinate order binding explicit and avoids accidental transcript
collisions between extension limbs.

### Field Reduction Reference Utilities

`SubfieldParams<D>::new(k)` models the ring-subfield subgroup
`H = <sigma_-1, sigma_(4k+1)>` modulo `2D`.

It rejects malformed parameters before exponent enumeration:

- `D = 0`;
- non-power-of-two `D`;
- odd `D`;
- `k = 0`;
- `k` not dividing `D/2`;
- `gcd(4k + 1, 2D) != 1`.

`h_exponents()` enumerates distinct odd exponents in `H`.
`trace_h(params, x)` computes `sum_{sigma in H} sigma(x)`.
`psi_pack(params, values)` implements the coefficient-placement part of
The ring-subfield `psi` map:

```text
values[0 .. D/(2k))       -> coeffs[0 .. D/(2k))
values[D/(2k) .. D/k)     -> coeffs[D/2 .. D/2 + D/(2k))
```

This is not yet the complete `k > 1` proof-path embedding. It is a reference
utility with tests that anchor the algebra before the follow-up implementation.

### Field-Width Accounting

Proof-size and layout helpers take `field_bits` or derive it from
`Cfg::decomposition().field_bits()`. This affects:

- serialized field element byte counts;
- ring-vector byte estimates;
- sumcheck byte estimates;
- stage-1 proof-size estimates;
- batched root-layout scaling.

The important behavior is not that fp32/fp64 schedules are optimized or
security-calibrated, but that they no longer pay fp128 byte accounting by
construction. SIS rank floors and ring-dimension ladders remain a separate
modulus-family registry issue: fp32/fp64 must eventually use Q32/Q64 SIS tables
and larger candidate ring dimensions, while fp128 should use a Q128
representative such as `2^128 - (2^32 - 22537)` rather than silently reusing a
larger `2^128 - 275` table. A rough sizing intuition is
`fp128 D=32 ~ fp64 D=64 ~ fp32 D=128`, with D=256/D=512 candidates reserved for
small-field planning and profiling.

### Static Small-Field Profiles

The PR adds static fp32/fp64 config scaffolds under `akita-config` proof
optimized presets. They are intentionally small and planner-backed. Their job
is to make the existing end-to-end commit/prove/verify path run over smaller
base fields without changing the public API yet.

### Alternatives Considered

**Complete extension openings in this PR.**
Rejected because the moment `Cfg::ClaimField` becomes public input, the current
nested batch shape becomes the wrong abstraction for the optimized Frobenius
route. That belongs in the follow-up incidence-model PR.

**Add a one-poly-many-points API now.**
Rejected because it would create another public special case beside existing
same-point batching. The follow-up will use one general point/group/claim model.

**Replace the fp128 verifier shortcut with generic trace enumeration.**
Rejected because the shortcut is the hot production path and is exactly the
`k = 1` specialization. This PR tests the equivalence instead of slowing the
runtime path.

**Keep planner proof-size constants at 128 bits.**
Rejected because it would make fp32/fp64 configs pass functionally while giving
misleading proof-size and layout estimates.

## Documentation

This spec is the main documentation artifact for PR #60. The follow-up design
is documented in `specs/extension-field-opening-batching.md`.

No user-facing README/API documentation is required yet because extension-field
openings are not exposed by the public prover/verifier API in this PR.

  Q32/Q64/Q128 SIS floor tables before generating fp32/fp64 schedule tables.

  D=512 where appropriate, and select defaults from profile data rather than
  assuming the larger rings are faster or slower.
- [x] Add stack-backed sparse challenge sampler tiers through D=512 so larger
  small-field candidates do not use a heap-backed fallback.
- [x] Fix all-features zk setup sizing for extension-root-fold tests by
  reserving B-blinding columns in hand-rolled test configs.
